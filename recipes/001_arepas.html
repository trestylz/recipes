  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Arepas</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 cups masarepa (precooked instant cornmeal— (see note)</li>
<li>2 cups water</li>
<li>¼ cup sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
<li>1½ cups canned, frozen, or fresh corn kernels, cooked</li>
<li>8 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
<li>2 to 4 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Dump the cornmeal into a mixing bowl. Set aside. Combine the water, sugar, salt, and butter in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour it into the cornmeal and mix well.</li>
<li>Chop the corn kernels just a bit, and then mix them into the dough. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions and flatten each one out with your hands into a 4- to 5-inch disk. Lay the disks out on a piece of waxed or parchment paper. Slap the sliced mozzarella evenly on top of 6 of them, and cover each with one of the remaining disks to make a sandwich.</li>
<li>Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a cast-iron skillet set over medium heat. Slip a couple of arepas into the pan. Cook about 2 minutes, til golden brown. Flip and cook about 2 minutes on the other side. Flip back to the first side and cook 1 minute longer; then flip one last time and cook the second side til well browned around the edges. Let them sit a couple of minutes before cutting each one into 4 wedges. Finish cooking and cutting the remaining arepas in the same way, adding more oil to the pan if needed.</li>
<li>Grab a platter or individual plates, arrange the arepa wedges around a bowl of salsa, and dig in.</li>
</ol>
