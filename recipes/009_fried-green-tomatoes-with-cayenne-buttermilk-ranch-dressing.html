In another shallow bowl or plate, combine the panko crumbs, salt, cayenne pepper, and the remaining 2 teaspoons black pepper. Dip the tomato slices in the egg mixture and then in the panko crumbs, pressing to coat them well on both sides and around the edges. Lift the coated pieces onto a rack set over a baking sheet. Pop them in the fridge for half an hour to set the crumbs.",
    "Grab a heavy 12-inch skillet and heat the oil over medium heat. When the oil is hot, slide in a few tomatoes without crowding the pan. They should sizzle and bubble around the edges. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, til brown. Take them out of the pan, then add a bit more oil and get it hot before starting a second batch.",
    "Drain the fried tomato slices on paper towels. Arrange them around the outside edge of a plate, sprinkle them with some grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and set a bowl of Cayenne Buttermilk Ranch Dressing in the middle for dipping."
