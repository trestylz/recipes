  <h1>Fried Green Tomatoes with Cayenne Buttermilk Ranch Dressing</h1>
  <p><strong>Category:</strong> Starters</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Tomatoes</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 green tomatoes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creole Seasoning</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>Pinch plus 2 teaspoons black pepper</li>
<li>4 cups panko crumbs (Japanese-style dried bread crumbs— (see note)</li>
<li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
<li>½ cup vegetable oil, plus more as needed</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Garnish</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Core the tomatoes and cut off the ends. Slice them into ¼-inch rounds, and dry between several layers of paper towels to get rid of the excess moisture. Sprinkle lightly with Creole Seasoning on both sides.</li>
<li>Whisk together the eggs and a pinch of black pepper in a shallow bowl. In another shallow bowl or plate, combine the panko crumbs, salt, cayenne pepper, and the remaining 2 teaspoons black pepper. Dip the tomato slices in the egg mixture and then in the panko crumbs, pressing to coat them well on both sides and around the edges. Lift the coated pieces onto a rack set over a baking sheet. Pop them in the fridge for half an hour to set the crumbs.</li>
<li>Grab a heavy 12-inch skillet and heat the oil over medium heat. When the oil is hot, slide in a few tomatoes without crowding the pan. They should sizzle and bubble around the edges. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, til brown. Take them out of the pan, then add a bit more oil and get it hot before starting a second batch.</li>
<li>Drain the fried tomato slices on paper towels. Arrange them around the outside edge of a plate, sprinkle them with some grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and set a bowl of Cayenne Buttermilk Ranch Dressing in the middle for dipping.</li>
</ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Note: Panko crumbs are a bit coarser than other bread crumbs. They’re definitely better for this dish. You’ll find them in the Asian section of your supermarket or in Asian groceries.</li>
