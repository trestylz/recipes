<li>Film the bottom of a heavy skillet with a bit of the remaining olive oil, and set over medium heat. Put in a tortilla and cook on one side briefly, til tinged with brown. Take it out of the pan and continue with the rest of the tortillas, adding more oil if the pan looks dry. When they’re all done, spread out 4 of the tortillas on a work surface, browned side up. On each one, layer ½ cup pulled pork, ¼ cup cheese, and 2 tablespoons salsa. Top each one with another tortilla, browned side down.</li>
<li>Film the skillet with oil again and slide in one of the quesadillas. Flatten with a spatula and cook til the bottom is crisp and tinged with brown. Flip and cook the other side. Remove to a cutting board and cut into wedges. Keep warm while you’re cooking the rest. Serve with a dollop of sour cream or guacamole.</li>
