    "Grab the edge of the dough nearest you with two hands, and fold it up over the filling to the middle of the square. Flop the newly folded edge nearest you over again, this time three-fourths of the way up the square. Now reach over and bring the last part of the square—the part farthest from you—toward you and up onto the top. Pinch the dough together along the length of the seam and along the edges to seal.",
    "Oil a large jelly roll pan, and carefully flip the loaf onto the pan, seam side down. Brush the bread with oil and bake for 45 minutes, til golden brown. Cool for at least 20 minutes, and then cut into 1-inch slices. Serve warm."
