    "3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce",
    "2 tablespoons freshly squeezed orange juice",
    "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard",

    "Fix up the sauce. Grab a small saucepan and sling it over medium heat. Toss in the butter and, once it’s melted, add the shallots and garlic. Cook til they’re soft. Throw in the Worcestershire sauce, orange juice, mustard, Mutha Sauce, salt, and pepper. Give the sauce a stir and keep it warm on a back burner. Crumble the blue cheese and set it aside in the fridge.",
    "Fire up a skillet (cast iron works best) over high heat til smoking hot, about 8 minutes. While that’s going on, mix up the salt and pepper on a plate and press the steaks into it, coating them on both sides. Swirl the olive oil into the pan and then throw in the steaks. Cook til they’re a deep bronze color (not really black) on the outside and medium-rare on the inside. That’ll take about 4 minutes on each side, but you can cook them longer if that’s the way you like them (see Touch or Temp ). Plate up the steaks and keep them warm in a 140° oven while you’re finishing the sauce.",
    "Throw the blue cheese into the warm sauce as quickly as you can, and give it a little stir. Pour the sauce over the steaks before the cheese melts completely. Toss a few scallions over each steak and you’ve got a real shiner."
