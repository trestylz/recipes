  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Steak</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 London broil, flank steak, or top round (2 to 2 ½ pounds)</li>
<li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>½ cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
<li>½ cup chopped red onion</li>
<li>Pinch of kosher salt</li>
<li>Pinch plus 1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
<li>1 ¼ cups</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mutha Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>¼ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>2 to 3 tablespoons prepared horseradish</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>½ teaspoon molasses</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Needle the London broil with a fork, stabbing it all over. Make a wet rub by mixing the oil, Worcestershire, soy sauce, and Creole Seasoning together. Give the steak a good rubdown. For best results, do this step in the morning for cooking at night, but you can get by with just 4 hours of marinating if you have to.</li>
<li>Make up a batch of sauce. Heat the oil in a saucepan. Fry up the peppers and onions til soft, seasoning them with a pinch of salt and pepper. Throw in the garlic and cook another minute to soften it up a bit. Blend in the remaining 1 teaspoon pepper, the Mutha Sauce, Worcestershire, horseradish, cumin, and molasses. Warm the sauce up just before serving.</li>
<li>Build a medium coal bed in the grill, or set the gas dial to medium. Dry off the steak and throw it on the grill. Turn it over every once in a while til it’s a beautiful medium-rare (130° to 135°—see Touch or Temp ), 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Slice the steak thin across the grain, saving all those tasty beef juices to stir into the warmed-up sauce. Spoon the sauce over the sliced meat and it’s ready to serve.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4 TO 6</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 325°. Mix together 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, and the flour and rub it thoroughly into the meat. Pour the oil into a big, heavy Dutch oven, and get it nice and hot over medium heat. Brown both sides of the roast til deep brown, 5 to 8 minutes per side. Take the meat out of the pot and set aside.</li>
<li>Dump the onions, peppers, celery, and bay leaves into the pot. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook til soft and translucent. Throw in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the broth and the Mutha Sauce. Give it a good stir. Put the meat back in and bring the liquid to a boil. Cover with a lid and pop into the oven to simmer gently for 1 ½ hours.</li>
<li>Grab the corn on the cob and carefully slice each ear into 2-inch rounds. Toss the corn along with the sweet potatoes, all-purpose potatoes, and thyme in with the meat. Simmer for about 45 minutes longer, or til the veggies are soft and the meat is tender. Take the meat out of the pan and let it rest on a warm platter for about 15 minutes. Skim the fat off the surface of the pan gravy and if it seems a little thin, just reduce it on top of the stove. Fish out and toss the bay leaves. Slice the meat and cover with gravy and veggies. Sprinkle on the scallions for color before serving it up.</li>
<li>Beef Short Ribs Braised in BBQ Red Wine Sauce</li>
<li>FEEDS 4</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 325°. Mix up the flour and Creole Seasoning. Roll the ribs around in it til they’re coated on all sides. Fire up a skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. Brown the ribs til crusty on all sides, about 5 minutes per side. (If the ribs don’t all fit in the pan at once without crowding, do them in batches.) Move the ribs to a baking pan just big enough to hold them close.</li>
<li>Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of the hot oil from the skillet. Toss in the onions, green peppers, jalapeños, and bay leaves and cook, scraping in all those tasty brown bits clinging to the bottom of the pan. Season with a big pinch of salt and a dash of pepper, and cook til soft and light brown; then add the garlic and cook a minute more.</li>
<li>Pour in the red wine and let it bubble for 1 minute while scraping the skillet again. Add the Mutha Sauce, thyme, and water and simmer for a couple of minutes til blended.</li>
<li>Douse the ribs with the sauce and cover the pan snugly with foil. Bake for 2 hours. Remove from the oven and uncover. Skim off the fat floating on the surface. Stir up the sauce and taste for seasonings. Give the ribs a flip, cover them up again, and pop them back in the oven for another half hour or so, til they’re fork tender. Pull the ribs out of the oven, and fish out and discard the bay leaves. Reduce pan sauce if necessary. Serve each person 2 hot and steamy, well-sauced ribs sprinkled with parsley.</li>
<li>FEEDS 8</li>
<li>Check out the instructions in The Techniques of Outdoor Cookin’ and the Beef Brisket Pit Boss Tips .</li>
<li>Dump 6 cups of hickory wood chips into a bowl, cover with water, and soak for half an hour or so. Drain and divide the chips between 4 squares of aluminum foil. Wrap up into individual packets, poking holes in the top of each one. Set aside.</li>
<li>Pull off the grill rack and fire up the grill. While that’s going on, needle the brisket all over on both sides with a fork. Mix together the Creole Seasoning or All-Purpose Red Rub and oil. Rub this all over the brisket. Once your coals are good and hot, pile them up on one side of the bottom of the grill, and set two of the wood chip packets right on the coals. Position a drip pan filled with ½ inch of water on the side opposite the coals. Put the grill rack back in place. Set the brisket, fat side up, over the drip pan, and close the lid. After about half an hour, check the grill temperature. It should settle down to around 225°. If it’s hotter, close down the vent holes. If it’s cooler, open them up a bit.</li>
<li>Check the temperature of the grill every hour for the next 6 to 7 hours and make adjustments. If the temperature dips down to 200° or less, add a couple of hot new briquettes to the pile of gray coals, close the lid, and open the vent holes a bit.</li>
<li>Reach into the grill with some tongs after the brisket’s been smoking for 1 ½ hours, and remove the old packets of wood chips. Toss two new packets of foil-wrapped chips onto the coals.</li>
<li>After the brisket has been on the grill for 3 hours, you have achieved the necessary smoke penetration. Grab the meat with tongs, remove it from the grill, and wrap it tightly in foil. Return the foil-wrapped brisket to the grill and cover. Now you’re sealing in the succulence of the meat as you continue to cook it to an internal temperature of 175° to 180°. This will take another 3 to 4 hours, so keep working to maintain an even grill temperature of 225° to 250°.</li>
<li>Give that finished brisket a rest off the heat in its foil packet for 15 minutes. Save all the roasting juices and skim off the fat. Slice the meat thinly across the grain. Fan the slices out on a platter and pour some of those roasting juices over them. Serve with some warmed Mutha Sauce to spoon over the meat at the table.</li>
<li>Not Your Mama’s Meatloaf</li>
<li>FEEDS 6 TO 8</li>
<li>Preheat your oven to 350°. Swirl the olive oil in a hot skillet. Toss in the onions and peppers with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook til soft. Add the garlic and cook just a bit more. Then scrape it all into a large bowl. Crumble in the ground beef and the sausage and mix everything together with your hands.</li>
<li>Take the bread over to the faucet and wet it down, then squeeze it out like a sponge. Chop it up nice and fine and throw it in with the other ingredients. Pour in ¾ cup of the Mutha Sauce and sprinkle on the chili powder, cumin, cayenne, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 teaspoons pepper. Mix it all up with your hands. Add the eggs, and mix one more time.</li>
<li>Press the mixture into a 9 ½ by 5 ½-inch loaf pan. Slather on the remaining ½ cup Mutha Sauce. Pop it into the oven and bake for 1 ½ hours. Take it out and let it set 20 minutes. Pour off the fat. Slice into thick, comforting slabs. Serve with more Mutha Sauce at the table, so folks can ladle it on if they feel like it.</li>
<li>Dinosaur-Style Macaroni &amp; Cheese Shepherd’s Pie</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375°. Bring a big pot of water to a bubbling boil. Add 2 tablespoons of the salt, and stir in the pasta shells. Cook til al dente. Drain, rinse in cold water, and set aside.</li>
<li>Throw a skillet on medium heat and swirl in the vegetable oil. Add half the onions and half the peppers, cooking them til soft. Toss in the garlic and cook for about 1 minute more. Dump in the ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook it with the veggies til it loses its pinkness. Season with 1 ½ teaspoons each of salt and pepper. Mix in the Mutha Sauce and take the pan off the heat.</li>
<li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, and fry up the rest of the onions and peppers til soft. Add the flour and whisk like crazy til very well blended. Slowly dribble in the half-and-half or milk, whisking as you go. When the mixture bubbles and thickens slightly, remove it from the heat. Stir in 2 cups of the Cheddar, the Parmigiano-Reggiano, mustard, and the remaining 1 ½ teaspoons each of salt and pepper. Spice the sauce up with Tabasco to your liking. Stir til the cheeses are melted, then fold the cheese sauce into the drained pasta and set aside.</li>
<li>Grease up a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Spread the ground beef mixture in the pan, and then spread the mac ‘n’ cheese over it. Top everything with the last cup of Cheddar, and pop it into the preheated oven to bake for 30 to 45 minutes, or til the cheese sauce bubbles around the edges. Let the dish rest for 15 minutes before serving—if people can wait that long to eat it.</li>
<li>Garlic-Spiked Roast Beef with Portabella Mushroom Sauce</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Stab the meat with a thin knife and stuff the garlic slices into the slits. Make a loose rub with the olive oil and Creole Seasoning; then massage it into the roast. Let the roast sit in the rub for a couple of hours, if you’ve got the time, or cook it up right away.</li>
<li>Set the roast, fat side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Roast for 1 to 1 ¼ hours, or til a meat thermometer hits 135° (see Touch or Temp ).</li>
<li>Get to work on the sauce while the meat’s roasting. Clean and chop two-thirds of the mushrooms, and slice the remaining third. Set aside. In hot olive oil, flash-cook the onions and peppers with a pinch of salt and pepper for about a minute. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook til nice and soft. Toss in the bay leaves and garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Pour in the wine and simmer for 2 minutes. Add the broth and simmer for 10 minutes more. Then add the sliced portabellas, parsley, and oregano. Give it a good seasoning with salt and pepper. Pull out and discard the bay leaves. At the very end, finish the sauce with the heavy cream. Keep it warm, but don’t let it boil.</li>
<li>Slice the meat across the grain. Pour any juices that have collected on the cutting board or in the roasting pan into the sauce. Serve up the sliced meat with some sauce ladled over it.</li>
<li>Ropa Vieja (Shredded Beef in Cuban Creole Sauce)</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 325°. Season the flank steak with salt and pepper. Schlepp a heavy 12-inch skillet over to the stove and heat the olive oil in it. Brown one side of the steak for about 4 minutes over high heat. Flip it over and add the carrots, onions, garlic, and bay leaves around the edges. Season everything with another pinch of salt and pepper. Brown the meat and veggies for 4 to 5 minutes more to get some nice caramelization going on. Add the broth. Bring just to a boil, cover, and pop into the oven and simmer til the beef is fork tender, 1 ½ to 2 hours.</li>
<li>Take the beef out of the pan and wrap it tightly in foil, saving all those tasty veggies and cooking juices. Let the beef rest for about 20 minutes, and then shred it with your fingers into long stringy pieces along the grain of the meat. Meanwhile, strain out the bay leaves and the veggies. Return the cooking liquid to the pan and boil everything down til you’ve got 1 cup of liquid. Mix the shredded beef back into the liquid in the pan.</li>
<li>Make a batch of sauce. Heat the oil in a skillet and cook the onions, green peppers, and jalapeños with a pinch of salt and pepper til soft. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Stir in the tomato sauce. Simmer for 15 minutes. Season with the cumin, oregano, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Add the shredded beef, simmer til heated through, and then check for seasonings.</li>
<li>Spoon Perfect Rice around the edges of a serving platter, and heap up the Ropa Vieja in the middle. Top it off with peas and red pepper strips. Let the feast begin.</li>
<li>Pour the Mojito Marinade into the Ropa Vieja in the pan with the braising liquid, and mix it all up. Let the meat soak up all those good flavors for at least 4 hours.</li>
<li>Grab one handful of shredded meat at a time, squeeze out as much of the marinade as you can, and shape the meat into a flattened patty about the size of your palm. Cover the bottom of a large skillet with ⅛ to ¼ inch of oil, and get it heated up over medium. Add the patties and fry a few at a time in the oil, cooking them til crispy and richly browned on each side. Watch them carefully so they don’t burn.</li>
<li>Slide the fried patties onto a plate and serve ’em up with Black Beans &amp; Rice.</li>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want to make people stop, sit down, and eat, just put this classic comfort food on their plates. The rounds of corn on the cob give the dish a mellow sweetness.</li>
<li>Cook ’em low and slow. That’s the secret to tender short ribs. I like mine spicy, rich, and mahogany brown.</li>
<li>In Tioga, Texas, Gene Autry’s hometown, there’s a place called Clark’s where they make some of the best barbecue brisket on the planet. They say they smoke theirs for 3 days at 140°. But we’re not gonna put you through all that. It just takes a dedicated pit boss with 6 to 8 hours to spare and a good technique to get the right smoke penetration and produce a juicy but well-done piece of meat in a fraction of the time. That sounds like a contradiction, but it’s possible. All you need is an afternoon with plenty of beer on hand, a bit of patience, and the recipe that follows.</li>
<li>My mother is a great cook, but she never made meatloaf like this, and I bet yours never did either. It’s the spice that gives ours its touch of creepin’ heat. Way before meatloaf made a comeback on restaurant menus we were servin’ it at the Dinosaur. It was our very first special.</li>
<li>Here’s a twist on a classic British pub recipe. The beefy base of the pie gets flavored up Dino-style and topped off with savory mac ‘n’ cheese instead of the traditional mashed potatoes. It makes a hearty meal. Just add salad.</li>
<li>Dino, our ever-vigilant head of security, is also a helluva good cook, though he hasn’t ingested a vegetable since the mid ’60s. This is how he makes roast beef, and this is how I like to sauce it—sneaking in lots of luscious mushrooms. Try to get your hands on the baby bellas. They’re packed with flavor and slice up nicely into bite-size pieces.</li>
<li>This Cuban Creole dish, whose name means “old clothes,” knocks me out every time I eat it. You can cook and shred up the flank steak way in advance, then dinner is only half an hour away when you’re hungry for some good robust Latin flavors.</li>
<li>Note: The beef can be cooked and shredded a day ahead, if you’ve got the time.</li>
<li>Vaca Frita, “fried cow,” is a citrus-flavored variation of the Cuban dish Ropa Vieja, “old clothes.” These incredibly tasty, crispy fritters of shredded beef are so good, they’ll give you cravings that you never had before.</li>
