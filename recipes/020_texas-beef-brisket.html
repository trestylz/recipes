    "Dump 6 cups of hickory wood chips into a bowl, cover with water, and soak for half an hour or so. Drain and divide the chips between 4 squares of aluminum foil. Wrap up into individual packets, poking holes in the top of each one. Set aside.",
    "Pull off the grill rack and fire up the grill. While that’s going on, needle the brisket all over on both sides with a fork. Mix together the Creole Seasoning or All-Purpose Red Rub and oil. Rub this all over the brisket. Once your coals are good and hot, pile them up on one side of the bottom of the grill, and set two of the wood chip packets right on the coals. Position a drip pan filled with ½ inch of water on the side opposite the coals. Put the grill rack back in place. Set the brisket, fat side up, over the drip pan, and close the lid. After about half an hour, check the grill temperature. It should settle down to around 225°. If it’s hotter, close down the vent holes. If it’s cooler, open them up a bit.",
    "Check the temperature of the grill every hour for the next 6 to 7 hours and make adjustments. If the temperature dips down to 200° or less, add a couple of hot new briquettes to the pile of gray coals, close the lid, and open the vent holes a bit.",
    "Reach into the grill with some tongs after the brisket’s been smoking for 1 ½ hours, and remove the old packets of wood chips. Toss two new packets of foil-wrapped chips onto the coals.",
    "After the brisket has been on the grill for 3 hours, you have achieved the necessary smoke penetration. Grab the meat with tongs, remove it from the grill, and wrap it tightly in foil. Return the foil-wrapped brisket to the grill and cover. Now you’re sealing in the succulence of the meat as you continue to cook it to an internal temperature of 175° to 180°. This will take another 3 to 4 hours, so keep working to maintain an even grill temperature of 225° to 250°.",
    "Give that finished brisket a rest off the heat in its foil packet for 15 minutes. Save all the roasting juices and skim off the fat. Slice the meat thinly across the grain. Fan the slices out on a platter and pour some of those roasting juices over them. Serve with some warmed Mutha Sauce to spoon over the meat at the table.",
    "If your brisket gets done before the rest of your meal, hold it, still wrapped in foil, in a 140° oven.",
    "Check your smoke penetration. When you slice the meat, you’ll see a rosy border all the way around. If that border is ⅛ inch, you’re doin’ a reasonable job of smokin’ the meat. If it’s ¼ inch, you’re on your way to bein’ a pit boss, and if it’s ⅜ inch, come see me about a job!"
