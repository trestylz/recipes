  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Ropa Vieja</h3>
<ul>
<li>, made without the Cuban Creole Sauce</li>
<li>1 cup</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mojito Marinade</h3>
<ul>
<li>Olive oil for frying</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pour the Mojito Marinade into the Ropa Vieja in the pan with the braising liquid, and mix it all up. Let the meat soak up all those good flavors for at least 4 hours.</li>
<li>Grab one handful of shredded meat at a time, squeeze out as much of the marinade as you can, and shape the meat into a flattened patty about the size of your palm. Cover the bottom of a large skillet with ⅛ to ¼ inch of oil, and get it heated up over medium. Add the patties and fry a few at a time in the oil, cooking them til crispy and richly browned on each side. Watch them carefully so they don’t burn.</li>
<li>Slide the fried patties onto a plate and serve ’em up with Black Beans &amp; Rice.</li>
</ol>
