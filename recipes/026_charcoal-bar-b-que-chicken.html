  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>8 chicken quarters (leg and thigh, breast and wing, or a combination of both)</li>
<li>⅔ cup olive oil</li>
<li>7 tablespoons</li>
</ul>
<h3>All-Purpose Red Rub</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 cups</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Prep the chicken by breaking the joint between the leg and thigh, and trim away any backbone attached to the thigh. Tuck the wing tip under the spot where the wing joins the breast. Mix up the oil and All-Purpose Red Rub, and massage it into the chicken pieces. On the breast pieces you can even lift up the skin and massage the rub right into the flesh. Cover and refrigerate the chicken til you’re ready to grill it.</li>
<li>Build a medium coal bed in your grill. It should register 325° to 350° with the lid down. Open the lid and position the rack as high above the coals as possible. (This keeps the skin from getting too charred before the chicken is cooked through.) Arrange the chicken pieces, skin side up, directly over the coals. Close the lid and cook for 25 to 30 minutes; then give the chicken a flip, skin side down, and cook, covered, for 20 minutes more, or til it has an internal temperature of 160° to 165°. Check the chicken, and push the pieces that look the most cooked to the cooler edge of the grill. Keep cooking the thicker pieces, moving them to the hotter spots on the grill til they reach the same amount of doneness.</li>
<li>Flip all the pieces skin side up and slather on the Mutha Sauce. Close the lid of the grill and cook for 10 to 15 minutes more to glaze the chicken. Serve with more Mutha Sauce for ladling.</li>
<li>There are a couple of secrets to producing a juicy charcoal barbecue turkey. The first is to use a great bird. We use locally produced Plainville Farms fresh turkey, which is raised without the routine use of antibiotics (see Resources ). The other secret is to get the spice rub up under the skin and then cook the bird over indirect heat.</li>
<li>FEEDS 6 TO 8</li>
<li>Flip the breast, skin side down, onto a cutting board. Take a chef’s knife and carefully cut just through the breastbone, not the meat. Flip the breast again and flatten it out, using the heel of your hand. Mix up the olive oil and Creole Seasoning and smear the breast with it on all sides and even up under the skin. If you can, do this in the morning for evening grilling.</li>
<li>Fire up the grill, putting all the charcoal to one side. Put the breast, skin side down, directly over the hot coals for 5 minutes to caramelize the skin. Flip the breast over again, rib side down, this time moving it away from the coals to cook it over indirect heat. Cover the grill and cook for about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Test the internal temperature of the meat by inserting an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the breast. When it reads 155°, slather the skin side of the breast with the Mutha Sauce. Close the lid and keep cooking to glaze the breast til the thermometer reads 165°, 15 to 20 minutes more.</li>
<li>Pull the breast off the grill and let it rest for 10 minutes before carving. Serve the slices hot with some more Mutha Sauce. The leftovers make great sandwiches.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4</li>
<li>Oil the chicken and season on both sides with salt, cracked pepper, and a sprinkling of thyme.</li>
<li>Build a medium coal bed in your grill. It should register from 325° to 350° with the lid down. Open the grill and arrange the chicken skin side up with the thickest parts to the center. Close the lid and cook for 25 to 30 minutes. Give the chicken a flip so the skin side’s down and cook, covered, til golden, about 20 minutes more, or til it reaches an internal temperature of 160° to 165°.</li>
<li>Fix up a batch of sauce while the chicken’s cooking. Toast the pecans in a 350° oven til fragrant and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Chop them coarsely. Set aside.</li>
<li>Heat the oil gently in a saucepan over medium heat, add the onions, garlic, and jalapeños with a pinch of salt and pepper, and cook til soft. Pour in the chicken broth and the Mutha Sauce; simmer til reduced by a quarter, about 15 minutes. Add the chile, cumin, honey, and pecans. Keep warm. Just before serving, take the sauce off the heat and swirl in the butter, one piece at a time, til melted. Stir in the scallions.</li>
<li>Pull the chicken pieces off the grill and serve them smothered in sauce.</li>
<li>Stuffed Chicken Highbrow</li>
<li>Wash the asparagus and snap off the tough bottoms of the spears. Pour an inch of water into a skillet. Season with salt and add the garlic cloves. Bring to a simmer. Slide in the asparagus and cook til tender. Remove from the water, discarding the garlic. Set aside. In another skillet, cook the sausages whole and set aside.</li>
<li>Pull off the tenders from the inside of the breasts and save them for another use. Leave the breasts whole, and with the smooth side down, open like a book on a work surface. Flatten them with a meat/poultry pounder or mallet to ¼-inch thickness. Season breasts with salt and pepper. Slice the sausages thinly on the diagonal and place the slices on one side of each whole breast, leaving a thin border uncovered around the edge. On top of the sausage, layer 5 of asparagus spears, letting the points hang out at the ends. Cut 12 thin slices from the goat cheese, and put 3 on top of the asparagus on each chicken breast. Sprinkle with scallions.</li>
<li>Fold the uncovered lobe of each breast over the stuffed one to make a packet. Press around the edge to seal. Gently oil the chicken and season with salt and a light dusting of Creole Seasoning.</li>
<li>Build a medium bed of coals in your grill. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes on each side. Check the temperature by inserting an instant-read thermometer horizontally into the thickest part of one side, close to the stuffing. It should register 160°.</li>
<li>When the chicken breasts are done, take them off the grill, plate them, and serve with a little heated Mutha Sauce ladled over each portion.</li>
<li>Mix together, in order, the yogurt, ginger, garlic, lime juice, paprika, salt, cinnamon, cumin, coriander, pepper, allspice, mustard seeds, and honey. Set aside. Make slits 3 to 4 ½ inches long on the top side of each chicken breast. Spread the breasts out in a shallow nonreactive pan. Cover with the marinade, and marinate at least overnight—they just get better and better the longer you soak them—even up to 48 hours.</li>
<li>Make the topping. Swirl the olive oil into a skillet and heat over medium-high. Toss in the onion and pepper strips and cook til soft, seasoning them with a pinch of salt and pepper; then add ½ cup of the Mutha Sauce. Cook a little longer, til thickened. Set aside.</li>
<li>Build a medium coal bed in your grill. Position the breasts—top side down first—and grill for 5 to 6 minutes. Then flip them over and cook them for another 5 to 6 minutes, or til done. Brush with the remaining Mutha Sauce right before taking them off the grill. This gives them a nice rosy finish.</li>
<li>Mound a spoonful of the topping on each breast, sprinkle with cilantro, and serve.</li>
<li>Strip the skin from the chicken thighs and season lightly with Creole Seasoning. Toss them around in some flour, knocking off any excess. Pour ¼ inch of peanut oil in a heavy skillet and fire it up over medium-high heat til it’s hot but not smoking. Fry the thighs til golden and cooked through, about 20 minutes. Flip them once after 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Get busy making the sauce while the chicken’s cooking. Slap a small saucepan on the stove and add the peanut oil. Heat the oil over medium heat, and add the garlic, ginger, and jalapeños. Cook til the veggies are soft, then add the soy sauce, lemon zest, lemon juice, honey, sesame oil, and Mutha Sauce. Simmer for 5 minutes. Push the sauce off the direct heat, but keep it warm.</li>
<li>Check the chicken, and once it’s done, take it out of the oil and let it drain briefly. Dip each piece in the sauce and arrange on a platter. Sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds over the chicken, and serve with any sauce that’s left.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4 TO 6</li>
<li>Strip the skin from the thighs, and season generously with Creole Seasoning.</li>
<li>Heat the oil over medium-high in a deep pan, and brown the thighs til golden, about 3 minutes on each side. It’s better to cook the chicken in batches than to crowd the pan. Put the browned thighs on a plate.</li>
<li>Pour off all but 3 tablespoons of the oil, and slap the pan back on the heat. Throw in the onions, seasoning them with a pinch of salt and pepper, and cook til soft; then add the garlic and paprika and cook a few minutes longer. Stir in the Mutha Sauce and chicken broth and bring to a boil; put the chicken back in the pan, along with any juices left behind.</li>
<li>Cover the pan and lower the heat to medium-low. Simmer for 30 minutes, or til the chicken is done. Slowly add the sour cream to the sauce, stirring til well blended. Adjust the seasonings, adding more Creole Seasoning if you think it needs it. Stir in the scallions and serve with lots of buttered noodles.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4 (OR 8 IF HALF BREASTS ARE USED)</li>
<li>Peel the eggplants and cut into ½ -inch rounds. Salt each round well. Layer them in a colander and let the slices drain for at least 30 minutes. Then give them a good squeezing between layers of paper towels. Squirt lemon juice over them and lightly sprinkle both sides with Creole Seasoning.</li>
<li>Build a medium coal bed in your grill. Brush the eggplant slices with oil, and grill for a couple of minutes on both sides, til tender, basting with some of the Mutha Sauce. Set the eggplant aside, but keep warm.</li>
<li>Cut slits in the top smooth side of the chicken breasts. Rub both sides with olive oil and season well with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
<li>Stack the basil leaves right on top of one another. Roll them up like a good cigar and slice them into thin ribbons. Set aside.</li>
<li>Open out the breasts butterfly fashion and place them on the grill with the slits up. Grill til golden, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip and grill til just cooked, about the same amount of time again. Brush the breasts with some of the Mutha Sauce. With the breasts still on the grill, cover them with slices of eggplant and most of the basil (reserve a bit for garnishing). Tear pieces of prosciutto to fit each breast, layer the pieces over the basil, and brush with some more of the Mutha Sauce. Top each with 1 ½ slices of provolone. Now you can close the lid of the grill and heat them til the cheese melts, or you can take the breasts off the grill and finish them under the broiler.</li>
<li>Sprinkle each portion with some of the remaining basil, and dig in.</li>
<li>Oven-Roasted Mojito Chicken</li>
<li>Spread the chicken out in a baking dish, and pour the Mojito Marinade over it. Get personal with the pieces and rub some of the marinade right up under the skin. Marinate the chicken for 4 hours, or overnight, in the fridge.</li>
<li>Turn the oven on to 375°. Scatter the onion slices over the bottom of a roasting pan, and put the chicken on top, skin side up. Pour the remaining marinade over the chicken and onions, and pop the pan into the oven. Roast for 1 hour and 15 minutes, til the chicken is golden and cooked through.</li>
<li>Lift the chicken pieces out of the pan and arrange them on a platter. Stir up the pan juices, adding a bit of fresh Mojito Marinade (if you have it) to wake up the flavors. Spoon the onions and pan juices over the chicken. Sprinkle with parsley or cilantro and garnish the dish with lime wedges. Get everybody to squeeze some lime over their portion for added flavor. Serve with Perfect Rice on the side.</li>
<li>FEEDS 6</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Scrub the potatoes and cut each one lengthwise into 8 wedges, leaving the skin on. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.</li>
<li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium-high. Cook the chicken for about 4 minutes on each side, and transfer to the biggest roasting pan you own.</li>
<li>Throw the potato wedges into the oil left in the skillet and cook them for 1 minute on each side. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the potatoes to the roasting pan with the chicken. If they don’t all fit in a single layer, oil up another roasting pan and put the rest of the wedges in there.</li>
<li>Dump all but 2 tablespoons of the oil out of the skillet. Put it back on the heat and add the garlic. Cook for 1 minute and then stir in the marsala, lemon juice, Mutha Sauce, oregano, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute. Pour half of the sauce over the chicken and potatoes, saving the rest. Cover the roasting pan(s) with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and flip over the chicken and potatoes. Bake, uncovered, another 15 minutes. Flip the pieces again and pour the rest of the sauce over everything. Bake for 10 minutes more, til the chicken and potatoes are tender and glazed with the sauce.</li>
<li>Mound the chicken pieces in the center of a large platter. Then pile a ring of potato wedges around them, and scatter the peas over the top. Serve it hot and smokin’—just like a volcano.</li>
<li>Pull out the chicken tenders, if still attached, so you have a nice flat piece of meat. Sprinkle both sides of the breasts and tenders with Creole Seasoning. Line them up in a nonreactive baking pan and pour on the buttermilk. Cover and let marinate in the fridge for 4 hours or longer.</li>
<li>Mix up the flour, ¼ cup of Creole Seasoning, and the salt. Spread it out in a flat pan. Fish the chicken pieces out of the buttermilk, and press them into the flour mixture, coating them well all over.</li>
<li>Pour ¼ inch of oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet. Heat over medium-high til almost smoking. Add the chicken pieces without crowding the pan. Turn down the heat to medium and fry for about 5 minutes on each side. You might have to fry the chicken in 2 batches; if you do, keep the first batch warm in a 140° oven while you finish cooking. Serve hot, crisp, and golden with some Cayenne Buttermilk Ranch Dressing ladled over it.</li>
<li>Chicken with Andouille Sausage &amp; Peppers</li>
<li>Spice up the chicken pieces by sprinkling Creole Seasoning all over them and rubbing it in for good flavor penetration. Pour the oil into a skillet set over medium-high heat. When it’s hot but not smoking, add the chicken pieces and brown for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Take them out and put them on a platter. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the skillet.</li>
<li>Scoop up the onions and peppers and toss them into the remaining oil. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook them, scraping up all the delicious browned bits of chicken clinging to the bottom of the pan. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, til the veggies get soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
<li>Douse the softened veggies with the broth and the Mutha Sauce. Toss in the bay leaves, pepperoncini, and thyme and pour in the vinegar. Give everything a good stir. Grab the chicken pieces and put them into the pan, skin side up. Bring to a simmer, partially cover, and let the ingredients simmer actively over medium heat for 20 minutes. While this is going on, slice the andouille sausage ½ inch thick and cook briefly in another skillet over medium heat to render out some of the fat. Take the slices out of the skillet and drain on paper towels. When the chicken has been simmering for 20 minutes, add the drained sausage to it, flip the chicken pieces so they’re skin side down, and simmer for 15 minutes more.</li>
<li>Skim any oil from the surface of the sauce, fish out the bay leaves, and taste the sauce to see if you need to add a little more seasoning. Fold in the butter and parsley. Serve immediately on a bed of steaming Perfect Rice.</li>
<li>Cut the chicken breasts into ¼-inch strips. Season them lightly with Creole Seasoning.</li>
<li>Fire up a large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil. When it’s hot but not smoking, add the chicken strips and cook for a couple of minutes on each side, til lightly browned. With a slotted spoon, scoop the chicken out of the pan and onto a plate. Set aside.</li>
<li>Dump the onions, peppers, and celery into the oil left in the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, til soft; then season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in the Mutha Sauce, tomatoes, broth, and bay leaves. Cover and simmer for 8 minutes; take off the lid and simmer for 2 minutes more.</li>
<li>Toss in the zucchini, olives, oregano, cumin, and thyme. Simmer for 2 minutes. Slide the chicken strips back into the pan and cook for 5 minutes more. Taste and season with 2 teaspoons Creole Seasoning. Take out the bay leaves and stir in the scallions.</li>
<li>Lay down a bed of Perfect Rice or macaroni on each plate, and spoon the chicken mixture over it. Serve while it’s pipin’ hot.</li>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The bite of chiles combined with the sweet crunchiness of toasted pecans give this saucy chicken dish lots of flavor and textural dimension. In other words, you’re gonna love it!</li>
<li>As far as Dinosaur patrons are concerned, anything with goat cheese is kinda suspicious. Add some asparagus and you’re tippin’ the highbrow scale—hence the name of this dish. Many have discovered the tangy difference goat cheese makes when matched up with our Mutha Sauce.</li>
<li>Note: If only thick asparagus spears are available, buy 10, cook them, and then cut each spear in half lengthwise.</li>
<li>Indian spices and tandoori cooking inspired this one. The spicy, yogurt-based marinade tenderizes skinless chicken breasts to perfection. They cook up so tender you won’t even need a knife.</li>
<li>This dish perfectly combines the bright, bold flavors of Asian spices, fresh lemon, and BBQ sauce. All you’ve gotta do is fry up some chicken thighs and dress them in a tart, clingy sauce. The result is some powerfully provocative flavors. This sauce also works well with grilled chicken.</li>
<li>I’m very partial to chicken thighs, with their silky, succulent flesh. Slathered in a BBQ sauce spiked with good Hungarian paprika and made velvety with sour cream, this is a sensuous dish on a cold winter night, especially when served with buttered noodles to sop up all the good sauce.</li>
<li>Just like the name says, this is a big chicken dish. Grilled whole boneless chicken breasts are layered with eggplant, prosciutto, basil, provolone, and BBQ sauce for a heaping meal-size portion. For those with dainty appetites, the same approach can be applied to half chicken breasts. You might even want to come up with your own grandiose combinations, like grilled zucchini, oregano, and feta; grilled portabella mushrooms, bacon, sautéed onions, and Cheddar; or grilled tomatoes, sliced sausage, chopped cilantro, and pepper-jack cheese. Remember, just think big.</li>
<li>Home cooking doesn’t get any easier than this. So if you’re serious about getting maximum flavor for a minimum amount of effort, this Cuban way of preparing chicken is for you. The onions and Mojito Marinade melt together into a tasty sauce that mingles well with some of our Perfect Rice.</li>
<li>The last time I was in Chi-Town, I got the history of my favorite Chicago dish. It seems that the Italian immigrants who grew up in the shadow of Mount Vesuvio and then came to settle in Chicago developed this chicken and potato dish to celebrate the abundance of meat available in their new country, as well as their Neapolitan roots. We’ve given it a Dinosaur twist to get Vesuvio really smokin’.</li>
<li>If you love good fried chicken, this is the quick version. It’s just like its namesake, “chicken-fried steak.” Breading up and frying a nice boneless flat piece of meat, whether it’s beef or chicken, will give you a meal in minutes. It makes a great main course, or try slappin’ the finished product in a crusty roll or even slicing it over a mess of salad greens.</li>
<li>This is a variation on an old Italian dish called Chicken Scaparello, which is made with cut-up chicken, sausage, onions, and peppers simmered in a tomato sauce. Out of respect, we gave our version a different name and spiced the dish up a bit usin’ sausages from Louisiana and a good dose of the Mutha Sauce. Either way it’s good home cookin’. So make it yourself and eat hearty.</li>
<li>This one-skillet dinner is loaded with flavor and easy to prepare. Serve over some steamin’ Perfect Rice or your favorite macaroni. You can also substitute boneless, skinless chicken thighs for some real concentrated chicken flavor—love that dark meat!</li>
