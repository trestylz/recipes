Tear pieces of prosciutto to fit each breast, layer the pieces over the basil, and brush with some more of the Mutha Sauce. Top each with 1 ½ slices of provolone. Now you can close the lid of the grill and heat them til the cheese melts, or you can take the breasts off the grill and finish them under the broiler.",
