  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Chicken</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 chicken (3 ½ pounds), cut into 8 pieces</li>
<li>1 cup</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mojito Marinade</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 large onion, sliced into ½ -inch rounds</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh Italian parsley or cilantro</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Garnish</h3>
<ul>
<li>Lime wedges</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Spread the chicken out in a baking dish, and pour the Mojito Marinade over it. Get personal with the pieces and rub some of the marinade right up under the skin. Marinate the chicken for 4 hours, or overnight, in the fridge.</li>
<li>Turn the oven on to 375°. Scatter the onion slices over the bottom of a roasting pan, and put the chicken on top, skin side up. Pour the remaining marinade over the chicken and onions, and pop the pan into the oven. Roast for 1 hour and 15 minutes, til the chicken is golden and cooked through.</li>
<li>Lift the chicken pieces out of the pan and arrange them on a platter. Stir up the pan juices, adding a bit of fresh Mojito Marinade (if you have it) to wake up the flavors. Spoon the onions and pan juices over the chicken. Sprinkle with parsley or cilantro and garnish the dish with lime wedges. Get everybody to squeeze some lime over their portion for added flavor. Serve with Perfect Rice on the side.</li>
<li>FEEDS 6</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Scrub the potatoes and cut each one lengthwise into 8 wedges, leaving the skin on. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.</li>
<li>Season the chicken with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat the oil in a large skillet set over medium-high. Cook the chicken for about 4 minutes on each side, and transfer to the biggest roasting pan you own.</li>
<li>Throw the potato wedges into the oil left in the skillet and cook them for 1 minute on each side. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the potatoes to the roasting pan with the chicken. If they don’t all fit in a single layer, oil up another roasting pan and put the rest of the wedges in there.</li>
<li>Dump all but 2 tablespoons of the oil out of the skillet. Put it back on the heat and add the garlic. Cook for 1 minute and then stir in the marsala, lemon juice, Mutha Sauce, oregano, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 1 minute. Pour half of the sauce over the chicken and potatoes, saving the rest. Cover the roasting pan(s) with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Uncover and flip over the chicken and potatoes. Bake, uncovered, another 15 minutes. Flip the pieces again and pour the rest of the sauce over everything. Bake for 10 minutes more, til the chicken and potatoes are tender and glazed with the sauce.</li>
<li>Mound the chicken pieces in the center of a large platter. Then pile a ring of potato wedges around them, and scatter the peas over the top. Serve it hot and smokin’—just like a volcano.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4 TO 6</li>
<li>Pull out the chicken tenders, if still attached, so you have a nice flat piece of meat. Sprinkle both sides of the breasts and tenders with Creole Seasoning. Line them up in a nonreactive baking pan and pour on the buttermilk. Cover and let marinate in the fridge for 4 hours or longer.</li>
<li>Mix up the flour, ¼ cup of Creole Seasoning, and the salt. Spread it out in a flat pan. Fish the chicken pieces out of the buttermilk, and press them into the flour mixture, coating them well all over.</li>
<li>Pour ¼ inch of oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet. Heat over medium-high til almost smoking. Add the chicken pieces without crowding the pan. Turn down the heat to medium and fry for about 5 minutes on each side. You might have to fry the chicken in 2 batches; if you do, keep the first batch warm in a 140° oven while you finish cooking. Serve hot, crisp, and golden with some Cayenne Buttermilk Ranch Dressing ladled over it.</li>
<li>Chicken with Andouille Sausage &amp; Peppers</li>
<li>Spice up the chicken pieces by sprinkling Creole Seasoning all over them and rubbing it in for good flavor penetration. Pour the oil into a skillet set over medium-high heat. When it’s hot but not smoking, add the chicken pieces and brown for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Take them out and put them on a platter. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the skillet.</li>
<li>Scoop up the onions and peppers and toss them into the remaining oil. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook them, scraping up all the delicious browned bits of chicken clinging to the bottom of the pan. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, til the veggies get soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
<li>Douse the softened veggies with the broth and the Mutha Sauce. Toss in the bay leaves, pepperoncini, and thyme and pour in the vinegar. Give everything a good stir. Grab the chicken pieces and put them into the pan, skin side up. Bring to a simmer, partially cover, and let the ingredients simmer actively over medium heat for 20 minutes. While this is going on, slice the andouille sausage ½ inch thick and cook briefly in another skillet over medium heat to render out some of the fat. Take the slices out of the skillet and drain on paper towels. When the chicken has been simmering for 20 minutes, add the drained sausage to it, flip the chicken pieces so they’re skin side down, and simmer for 15 minutes more.</li>
<li>Skim any oil from the surface of the sauce, fish out the bay leaves, and taste the sauce to see if you need to add a little more seasoning. Fold in the butter and parsley. Serve immediately on a bed of steaming Perfect Rice.</li>
<li>Cut the chicken breasts into ¼-inch strips. Season them lightly with Creole Seasoning.</li>
<li>Fire up a large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil. When it’s hot but not smoking, add the chicken strips and cook for a couple of minutes on each side, til lightly browned. With a slotted spoon, scoop the chicken out of the pan and onto a plate. Set aside.</li>
<li>Dump the onions, peppers, and celery into the oil left in the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, til soft; then season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in the Mutha Sauce, tomatoes, broth, and bay leaves. Cover and simmer for 8 minutes; take off the lid and simmer for 2 minutes more.</li>
<li>Toss in the zucchini, olives, oregano, cumin, and thyme. Simmer for 2 minutes. Slide the chicken strips back into the pan and cook for 5 minutes more. Taste and season with 2 teaspoons Creole Seasoning. Take out the bay leaves and stir in the scallions.</li>
<li>Lay down a bed of Perfect Rice or macaroni on each plate, and spoon the chicken mixture over it. Serve while it’s pipin’ hot.</li>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The last time I was in Chi-Town, I got the history of my favorite Chicago dish. It seems that the Italian immigrants who grew up in the shadow of Mount Vesuvio and then came to settle in Chicago developed this chicken and potato dish to celebrate the abundance of meat available in their new country, as well as their Neapolitan roots. We’ve given it a Dinosaur twist to get Vesuvio really smokin’.</li>
<li>If you love good fried chicken, this is the quick version. It’s just like its namesake, “chicken-fried steak.” Breading up and frying a nice boneless flat piece of meat, whether it’s beef or chicken, will give you a meal in minutes. It makes a great main course, or try slappin’ the finished product in a crusty roll or even slicing it over a mess of salad greens.</li>
<li>This is a variation on an old Italian dish called Chicken Scaparello, which is made with cut-up chicken, sausage, onions, and peppers simmered in a tomato sauce. Out of respect, we gave our version a different name and spiced the dish up a bit usin’ sausages from Louisiana and a good dose of the Mutha Sauce. Either way it’s good home cookin’. So make it yourself and eat hearty.</li>
<li>This one-skillet dinner is loaded with flavor and easy to prepare. Serve over some steamin’ Perfect Rice or your favorite macaroni. You can also substitute boneless, skinless chicken thighs for some real concentrated chicken flavor—love that dark meat!</li>
