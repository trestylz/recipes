  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Chicken</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 chicken (3 ½ pounds), cut into 8 pieces</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creole Seasoning</h3>
<ul>
<li>½ cup olive oil</li>
<li>1 large red onion, chopped</li>
<li>1 large red bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
<li>Pinch each of kosher salt and black pepper</li>
<li>8 to 10 large cloves garlic, chopped</li>
<li>2 cups chicken broth or stock (to make your own, see</li>
</ul>
<h3>Chicken Stock)</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 ½ cups</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mutha Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>3 bay leaves</li>
<li>4 to 5 pickled pepperoncini, cut in rounds</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
<li>⅓ cup red wine vinegar</li>
<li>¾ pound andouille sausage</li>
<li>2 tablespoons softened butter</li>
<li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Spice up the chicken pieces by sprinkling Creole Seasoning all over them and rubbing it in for good flavor penetration. Pour the oil into a skillet set over medium-high heat. When it’s hot but not smoking, add the chicken pieces and brown for 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Take them out and put them on a platter. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons of oil from the skillet.</li>
<li>Scoop up the onions and peppers and toss them into the remaining oil. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook them, scraping up all the delicious browned bits of chicken clinging to the bottom of the pan. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, til the veggies get soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
<li>Douse the softened veggies with the broth and the Mutha Sauce. Toss in the bay leaves, pepperoncini, and thyme and pour in the vinegar. Give everything a good stir. Grab the chicken pieces and put them into the pan, skin side up. Bring to a simmer, partially cover, and let the ingredients simmer actively over medium heat for 20 minutes. While this is going on, slice the andouille sausage ½ inch thick and cook briefly in another skillet over medium heat to render out some of the fat. Take the slices out of the skillet and drain on paper towels. When the chicken has been simmering for 20 minutes, add the drained sausage to it, flip the chicken pieces so they’re skin side down, and simmer for 15 minutes more.</li>
<li>Skim any oil from the surface of the sauce, fish out the bay leaves, and taste the sauce to see if you need to add a little more seasoning. Fold in the butter and parsley. Serve immediately on a bed of steaming Perfect Rice.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4 TO 6</li>
<li>Cut the chicken breasts into ¼-inch strips. Season them lightly with Creole Seasoning.</li>
<li>Fire up a large skillet over medium heat. Add the olive oil. When it’s hot but not smoking, add the chicken strips and cook for a couple of minutes on each side, til lightly browned. With a slotted spoon, scoop the chicken out of the pan and onto a plate. Set aside.</li>
<li>Dump the onions, peppers, and celery into the oil left in the pan. Cook for about 5 minutes, til soft; then season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Stir in the Mutha Sauce, tomatoes, broth, and bay leaves. Cover and simmer for 8 minutes; take off the lid and simmer for 2 minutes more.</li>
<li>Toss in the zucchini, olives, oregano, cumin, and thyme. Simmer for 2 minutes. Slide the chicken strips back into the pan and cook for 5 minutes more. Taste and season with 2 teaspoons Creole Seasoning. Take out the bay leaves and stir in the scallions.</li>
<li>Lay down a bed of Perfect Rice or macaroni on each plate, and spoon the chicken mixture over it. Serve while it’s pipin’ hot.</li>
</ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>This one-skillet dinner is loaded with flavor and easy to prepare. Serve over some steamin’ Perfect Rice or your favorite macaroni. You can also substitute boneless, skinless chicken thighs for some real concentrated chicken flavor—love that dark meat!</li>
