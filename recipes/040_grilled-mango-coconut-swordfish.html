<li>Olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Garnish</h3>
<ul>
<li>10 fresh basil leaves</li>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start with the sauce. Slice off the 2 ends of each mango. Stand them up on a cut end, and cut down close to the skin to peel it away. Slice the flesh away from the fibrous pit, and then dice the flesh. Toss the butter into a saucepan set over medium-high heat. Stir in the jalapeños and ginger with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, til soft. Add the mango and cook for 5 minutes more. Pour in the orange juice, coconut milk, and Mutha Sauce, and toss in 1 teaspoon salt. Turn the heat up to high and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-high and simmer 15 minutes, til reduced by half. Keep warm. Just before serving, stir in the orange zest, peppers, lime juice, and Tabasco.</li>
<li>Wash the basil leaves, dry them, and stack them. Roll the leaves tightly like a good cigar, and cut across the roll into thin ribbons. Set aside.</li>
<li>Fire up the grill. Cut the skin from the swordfish, and cut the fish in half lengthwise along the grain. Flip each half onto its side and cut into ½-inch-thick steaks across the grain. Rub the steaks down with oil and season with a sprinkling of Creole Seasoning on both sides.</li>
<li>Clean the grill rack and oil it. Spread out a nice hot coal bed. Position the rack and throw the steaks onto it, directly over the coals. Cook for about 2 minutes and flip. Cook for another 1 to 3 minutes or so, til done but not overcooked. These babies should be succulent.</li>
<li>Arrange the steaks on a platter and spoon on the sauce. Dress them up with a sprinkling of basil.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4</li>
<li>Make up a batch of sauce. Fry the bacon over medium-high heat just til crisp and brown. Pull it out of the pan, drain it on paper towels, crumble, and set aside.</li>
<li>Pour off all but 3 to 4 tablespoons of the bacon fat in the pan. Dump in the onions and fennel, seasoning with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sizzle over medium heat til brown and caramelized. Stir in the Mutha Sauce and lemon juice. Keep warm.</li>
<li>Toss the flour, Creole Seasoning, and a pinch of salt together. Dredge the fish in the mixture til the pieces are well coated.</li>
<li>Swirl the oil into a heavy skillet and heat it til hot but not smoking. Knock the excess flour off the fish pieces, and slip them into the skillet. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, til lightly browned. Flip the pieces over and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, til cooked through. With a slotted spatula, transfer the fish to a platter.</li>
<li>Top each portion with a spoonful of sauce, some bacon crumbles, and some sliced scallions. Serve it right away.</li>
<li>Grill-Smoked Salmon with Chile-Lime Booster Sauce</li>
<li>FEEDS 6</li>
<li>Douse 2 cups applewood chips with water to cover. Soak for half an hour. Remove the grill rack and fire up the grill.</li>
<li>Throw together the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Toss in the jalapeños and garlic. Cook for 2 minutes, then pour in the vinegar, lemon juice, and lime juice. Swirl in the Mutha Sauce, honey, and mint. Simmer briefly, then set the sauce aside and keep warm.</li>
<li>Crush the garlic and ginger to a paste along with the brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Work in the olive oil. Rub the mixture all over the pink flesh of the fish. Oil a piece of aluminum foil, and roll up the edges to make a pan for the fish. Place the fish on it, skin side down.</li>
<li>Check your grill. Once the coals are good and hot, push them off to one side. Drain the chips and scatter them over the coals. They’ll splatter a bit and then start smoking nicely. Reposition the grill rack and place the fish in its pan on the side opposite the coals to cook with indirect heat. Cover the grill and smoke slowly at 250° to 275° for 40 to 45 minutes, till cooked through. Drizzle the sauce over the fish. Slice into portions and serve fast.</li>
<li>Season both sides of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Pick out a pan large enough to hold the salmon nice and tight in one layer. Toss the butter into the pan and melt it over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and let them sweat out their flavors for 2 minutes, being careful not to let them brown.</li>
<li>Pour in the wine, water, and the Mutha Sauce. Then toss in the dill, sage, peppercorns, and mustard seeds. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Immerse the salmon, skin side down. Bring the liquid back up to a bubbly boil for 30 seconds. Cover the pan loosely with a lid and turn the heat way down low. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, til the fish begins to lightly flake. Gently lift the salmon out onto a plate, and keep it warm in a 140° oven.</li>
<li>Strain out the dill, sage, peppercorns, and mustard seeds, leaving just the poaching liquid in the pan. Turn the heat up to high and bring to a rapid boil. Reduce the liquid for 2 minutes. Make the sauce by whisking the mustard and Mutha Sauce into the poaching liquid. Add the dill and the pepper. Divide the salmon into 4 portions, placing each on a soup plate. Ladle the brothy sauce over each portion and garnish with a sprig of dill. Now enjoy the dancin’ flavors of this simple dish.</li>
<li>Sweet-Potato–Crusted Mahi-Mahi with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce</li>
<li>Preheat the broiler. Line a small low-sided pan with aluminum foil. Set the peppers in it and stick the pan under the flaming hot broiler. Broil for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, til the skin blisters and blackens. Drop the peppers into a brown paper bag and seal them up for several minutes to let the steam loosen their skins. Pull the peppers out, peel, and remove the seeds. Dice the flesh and set aside.</li>
<li>Whip up the sauce. Fling a saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in the oil and let it heat. Add the onions and shallots, seasoning with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook til soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more before dumping in the peppers. Douse with the broth, Mutha Sauce, heavy cream, and lemon juice. Simmer 5 minutes, then transfer the steaming contents of the saucepan to a food processor. Whirl til smooth, and scrape the sauce back into the saucepan. Keep warm.</li>
<li>Inspect your fish fillets. If they have high spots, slice these down to get the thickness as even as possible. Season the fillets with salt and pepper, and spread the top side of each with 1 scant tablespoon of mustard.</li>
<li>Take handfuls of shredded potatoes and squeeze out the moisture. Press 4 to 5 tablespoons of shreds onto the top of each fillet so they stick to the mustard. Grind on lots of black pepper, and season with a pinch of salt.</li>
<li>Pour ½ cup of the oil into a nonstick frying pan. Set over medium heat til it sizzles when a drop of water is added. Cook 1 or 2 fillets at a time, potato side down first. Don’t crowd the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, til the potatoes are nice and brown but not burned. Don’t check til the fish has been cooking for at least 2 minutes. With a slotted spatula, carefully flip the fish over and cook for 2 to 4 minutes more, til cooked through. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels while cooking the other fillets. Add more oil as necessary, but be sure it’s nice and hot before adding more fish.</li>
<li>Ladle a puddle of sauce onto each of 4 plates. Nestle a fillet on top, and serve.</li>
<li>Make the sauce first. Dump the wasabi powder into a cup. Drizzle in 4 teaspoons of water, and mix to a paste. Set aside.</li>
<li>Set a small saucepan on the stove. Add the peanut oil and heat over medium-high. Toss in the garlic and ginger and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook briefly, til barely soft. Swirl in the Mutha Sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and wasabi paste. Add the scallions and give everything a stir.</li>
<li>Scrape the sauce into a food processor and give it a spin for 5 seconds, or til smooth. Scrape back into the saucepan and add the remaining ¼ cup water. Mix and keep warm.</li>
<li>Rub the tuna steaks with olive oil. Sprinkle one side of the tuna steaks with half of the five-spice powder, some salt, and lots of pepper. Flip them and season the other side the same way.</li>
<li>Build a hot coal bed in your grill. Clean and oil the rack. Put the steaks on and cook for 2 minutes, til colored ⅜ inch up from the bottom. Flip and cook the same amount on the other side, leaving a nice rare streak through the center. The internal temperature will be around 100°.</li>
<li>Serve immediately with a generous spoonful of sauce over each steak.</li>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Note: Make sure you get coconut milk, not cream of coconut. The only ingredients listed on the can should be coconut milk and water.</li>
<li>This dish was created for a local fiery food show. It happened to be Lent at the time, so we figured fish would be a good seasonal choice. Then someone reminded us that the bacon was an unholy partner. With apologies to the Pope, we served it anyway because it was that sinfully good.</li>
<li>Note: Fennel, sometimes called anise, is a bulbous vegetable with strings like celery and stalky tops tipped with feathery, aromatic leaves. It has a sweet licorice flavor that accents fish and poultry perfectly. The stalks are always removed, leaving just the bulbous bottom. Often you’ll need to pull off the outer ribs if they look tough and fibrous. Then cut the bulb lengthwise in quarters. Wash well because sometimes sand gets lodged between the ribs. Cut out the core and discard; then sliver or slice the fennel.</li>
<li>Cooter, our chef in Rochester, concocted this tongue-tinglin’ booster sauce. Its flavor dances all around in your mouth with every tender bite of the sweetly smoked salmon.</li>
<li>We don’t do much poachin’ at the restaurant, but at home it’s another story. This is how I like to fix salmon. It has a light, almost brothy BBQ sauce flavored with a bit of dill.</li>
<li>We think this is one fine fancy-pants dish. The sweet potato crust not only seals in the succulence of the fish but also gives it a crunchy, caramelized coating. The sauce of roasted red peppers simmered with lots of aromatics makes for a sexy finish.</li>
<li>The tickle factor in this dish comes from the wasabi—Japanese horseradish. You can find it in the Asian section of your supermarket. And since we’re cookin’ in an Asian mode, we like the tuna served nice and rare, almost like sushi.</li>
