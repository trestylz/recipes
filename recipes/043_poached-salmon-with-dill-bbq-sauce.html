<li>Black pepper</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Season both sides of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Pick out a pan large enough to hold the salmon nice and tight in one layer. Toss the butter into the pan and melt it over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger and let them sweat out their flavors for 2 minutes, being careful not to let them brown.</li>
<li>Pour in the wine, water, and the Mutha Sauce. Then toss in the dill, sage, peppercorns, and mustard seeds. Bring the mixture to a gentle boil. Immerse the salmon, skin side down. Bring the liquid back up to a bubbly boil for 30 seconds. Cover the pan loosely with a lid and turn the heat way down low. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, til the fish begins to lightly flake. Gently lift the salmon out onto a plate, and keep it warm in a 140° oven.</li>
<li>Strain out the dill, sage, peppercorns, and mustard seeds, leaving just the poaching liquid in the pan. Turn the heat up to high and bring to a rapid boil. Reduce the liquid for 2 minutes. Make the sauce by whisking the mustard and Mutha Sauce into the poaching liquid. Add the dill and the pepper. Divide the salmon into 4 portions, placing each on a soup plate. Ladle the brothy sauce over each portion and garnish with a sprig of dill. Now enjoy the dancin’ flavors of this simple dish.</li>

<li>FEEDS 4</li>
<li>Preheat the broiler. Line a small low-sided pan with aluminum foil. Set the peppers in it and stick the pan under the flaming hot broiler. Broil for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, til the skin blisters and blackens. Drop the peppers into a brown paper bag and seal them up for several minutes to let the steam loosen their skins. Pull the peppers out, peel, and remove the seeds. Dice the flesh and set aside.</li>
<li>Whip up the sauce. Fling a saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in the oil and let it heat. Add the onions and shallots, seasoning with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook til soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more before dumping in the peppers. Douse with the broth, Mutha Sauce, heavy cream, and lemon juice. Simmer 5 minutes, then transfer the steaming contents of the saucepan to a food processor. Whirl til smooth, and scrape the sauce back into the saucepan. Keep warm.</li>
<li>Inspect your fish fillets. If they have high spots, slice these down to get the thickness as even as possible. Season the fillets with salt and pepper, and spread the top side of each with 1 scant tablespoon of mustard.</li>
<li>Take handfuls of shredded potatoes and squeeze out the moisture. Press 4 to 5 tablespoons of shreds onto the top of each fillet so they stick to the mustard. Grind on lots of black pepper, and season with a pinch of salt.</li>
<li>Pour ½ cup of the oil into a nonstick frying pan. Set over medium heat til it sizzles when a drop of water is added. Cook 1 or 2 fillets at a time, potato side down first. Don’t crowd the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, til the potatoes are nice and brown but not burned. Don’t check til the fish has been cooking for at least 2 minutes. With a slotted spatula, carefully flip the fish over and cook for 2 to 4 minutes more, til cooked through. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels while cooking the other fillets. Add more oil as necessary, but be sure it’s nice and hot before adding more fish.</li>
<li>Ladle a puddle of sauce onto each of 4 plates. Nestle a fillet on top, and serve.</li>
<li>Make the sauce first. Dump the wasabi powder into a cup. Drizzle in 4 teaspoons of water, and mix to a paste. Set aside.</li>
<li>Set a small saucepan on the stove. Add the peanut oil and heat over medium-high. Toss in the garlic and ginger and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook briefly, til barely soft. Swirl in the Mutha Sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and wasabi paste. Add the scallions and give everything a stir.</li>
<li>Scrape the sauce into a food processor and give it a spin for 5 seconds, or til smooth. Scrape back into the saucepan and add the remaining ¼ cup water. Mix and keep warm.</li>
<li>Rub the tuna steaks with olive oil. Sprinkle one side of the tuna steaks with half of the five-spice powder, some salt, and lots of pepper. Flip them and season the other side the same way.</li>
<li>Build a hot coal bed in your grill. Clean and oil the rack. Put the steaks on and cook for 2 minutes, til colored ⅜ inch up from the bottom. Flip and cook the same amount on the other side, leaving a nice rare streak through the center. The internal temperature will be around 100°.</li>
<li>Serve immediately with a generous spoonful of sauce over each steak.</li>
</ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>We think this is one fine fancy-pants dish. The sweet potato crust not only seals in the succulence of the fish but also gives it a crunchy, caramelized coating. The sauce of roasted red peppers simmered with lots of aromatics makes for a sexy finish.</li>
<li>The tickle factor in this dish comes from the wasabi—Japanese horseradish. You can find it in the Asian section of your supermarket. And since we’re cookin’ in an Asian mode, we like the tuna served nice and rare, almost like sushi.</li>
