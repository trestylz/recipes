    "2 tablespoons minced garlic",

    "Preheat the broiler. Line a small low-sided pan with aluminum foil. Set the peppers in it and stick the pan under the flaming hot broiler. Broil for 4 to 5 minutes on each side, til the skin blisters and blackens. Drop the peppers into a brown paper bag and seal them up for several minutes to let the steam loosen their skins. Pull the peppers out, peel, and remove the seeds. Dice the flesh and set aside.",
    "Whip up the sauce. Fling a saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in the oil and let it heat. Add the onions and shallots, seasoning with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook til soft. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more before dumping in the peppers. Douse with the broth, Mutha Sauce, heavy cream, and lemon juice. Simmer 5 minutes, then transfer the steaming contents of the saucepan to a food processor. Whirl til smooth, and scrape the sauce back into the saucepan. Keep warm.",

    "Take handfuls of shredded potatoes and squeeze out the moisture. Press 4 to 5 tablespoons of shreds onto the top of each fillet so they stick to the mustard. Grind on lots of black pepper, and season with a pinch of salt.",
    "Pour ½ cup of the oil into a nonstick frying pan. Set over medium heat til it sizzles when a drop of water is added. Cook 1 or 2 fillets at a time, potato side down first. Don’t crowd the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, til the potatoes are nice and brown but not burned. Don’t check til the fish has been cooking for at least 2 minutes. With a slotted spatula, carefully flip the fish over and cook for 2 to 4 minutes more, til cooked through. Remove from the pan and drain on paper towels while cooking the other fillets. Add more oil as necessary, but be sure it’s nice and hot before adding more fish.",
    "Ladle a puddle of sauce onto each of 4 plates. Nestle a fillet on top, and serve."
