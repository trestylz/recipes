<ul>
<li>4 teaspoons wasabi powder</li>
<li>4 teaspoons plus ¼ cup water</li>
<li>2 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
<li>2 huge cloves garlic, chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
<li>Pinch each of kosher salt and black pepper</li>
<li>1 ¼ cups</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mutha Sauce</h3>

<li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar</li>
<li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
<li>¾ cup sliced scallions, green part only</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Fish</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 tuna steaks, 1 ¼ to 1 ½ inches thick (about 1 ½ pounds total)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon five-spice powder</li>
<li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Make the sauce first. Dump the wasabi powder into a cup. Drizzle in 4 teaspoons of water, and mix to a paste. Set aside.</li>
<li>Set a small saucepan on the stove. Add the peanut oil and heat over medium-high. Toss in the garlic and ginger and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook briefly, til barely soft. Swirl in the Mutha Sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, and wasabi paste. Add the scallions and give everything a stir.</li>
<li>Scrape the sauce into a food processor and give it a spin for 5 seconds, or til smooth. Scrape back into the saucepan and add the remaining ¼ cup water. Mix and keep warm.</li>
<li>Rub the tuna steaks with olive oil. Sprinkle one side of the tuna steaks with half of the five-spice powder, some salt, and lots of pepper. Flip them and season the other side the same way.</li>
<li>Build a hot coal bed in your grill. Clean and oil the rack. Put the steaks on and cook for 2 minutes, til colored ⅜ inch up from the bottom. Flip and cook the same amount on the other side, leaving a nice rare streak through the center. The internal temperature will be around 100°.</li>
<li>Serve immediately with a generous spoonful of sauce over each steak.</li>
</ol>
