Slide the meat away from the coals, to cook it with indirect heat. Cover the grill and adjust the heat so that it’s 325° to 350° inside. Roast for 50 to 60 minutes, til the internal temperature reaches about 145°.",
    "Get the sauce cooking while the meat roasts. Drop the butter in a saucepan and melt over low heat. Add the onions and season with salt and pepper. Cook slowly, stirring every now and then, til deeply caramelized. Add the broth, Mutha Sauce, and cumin. Keep warm over low heat.",
    "Check the meat with an instant-read thermometer, and once it reaches 145°, pull it off the grill and let it rest for 15 minutes. Carve the lamb across the grain into ¼-inch slices on a cutting board with a well to catch all those delicious juices. You might have to remove some odd connectors or cut the muscle clods into more manageable sizes, but do what you’ve gotta do and keep carving across the grain. Arrange the meat on a platter.",
    "Pour all the accumulated meat juices into the sauce, and boost the heat up for a minute or two to get it nice and hot. Stir in the mint and then ladle the sauce over the sliced lamb. It’s ready to go."
