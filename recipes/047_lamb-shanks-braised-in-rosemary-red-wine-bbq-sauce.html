Shove it in the oven to braise for 1 hour; then pull it out and give the shanks a flip. Pop them back in the oven to cook for another hour.",
    "Once the shanks are tender and the meat is pulling away from the bone, lift them out onto a good-looking platter. Cover and keep warm. Strain the braising liquid, and skim the grease. Pour the braising liquid into a small pan and reduce by half. Keep warm.",
    "Line up some dinner plates and mound a portion of Garlic & Cheddar Grits in the center of each one. Set a shank into each mound, spoon some of the sauce over each shank, and bring them to the table."
