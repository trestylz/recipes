  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Shanks</h3>
<ul>
<li>6 lamb shanks (about 4 ½ pounds)</li>
<li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
<li>⅓ cup plus ¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>2 ½ cups chopped onion</li>
<li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
<li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
<li>2 cups beef broth or stock (to make your own, see</li>
</ul>
<h3>Beef Stock)</h3>
<ul>
<li>3 sprigs rosemary</li>
<li>1 cup</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mutha Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>½ cinnamon stick</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350°. Grab a knife and make a couple of shallow slits through the silver skin on both sides of each shank. Sprinkle the meat on both sides with a generous amount of salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Schlepp a big, heavy frying pan over to the stove and heat it over medium-high. Pour in ⅓ cup olive oil and get it hot and fragrant. Add as many shanks as will fit comfortably in the pan without crowding, and cook til richly browned, about 4 minutes. Flip them over and brown the other side. Pull the shanks out and drop them in a roasting pan. Continue browning the rest of the shanks. Once all of them are done, clean out the pan and pour in the remaining ¼ cup olive oil.</li>
<li>Drag the pan back over medium-high heat and add the onions, seasoning them with salt and pepper. Cook til soft; then toss in the garlic and cook 1 minute more. Pour in the wine and broth and bring to a boil. Add the rosemary, Mutha Sauce, and cinnamon stick. Pour everything over the shanks and cover the roasting pan tightly with foil. Shove it in the oven to braise for 1 hour; then pull it out and give the shanks a flip. Pop them back in the oven to cook for another hour.</li>
<li>Once the shanks are tender and the meat is pulling away from the bone, lift them out onto a good-looking platter. Cover and keep warm. Strain the braising liquid, and skim the grease. Pour the braising liquid into a small pan and reduce by half. Keep warm.</li>
<li>Line up some dinner plates and mound a portion of Garlic &amp; Cheddar Grits in the center of each one. Set a shank into each mound, spoon some of the sauce over each shank, and bring them to the table.</li>

<li>Fire up the grill. While that’s heating, make the sauce. Toss the butter into a small saucepan and melt over medium heat. Add the shallots, season with salt and pepper, and cook til just wilted. Toss in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
<li>Splash in the red wine and add the rosemary and mustard. Raise the heat to high, and reduce the sauce rapidly for 2 to 3 minutes. Mix in the Mutha Sauce, lemon juice, and honey and simmer for a minute or two to blend the flavors. Keep warm.</li>
<li>Rub the chops down with oil. Season both sides with a generous sprinkling of lemon pepper. Place over the coals. Cook for about 4 minutes, then flip the chops and cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, or til a rosy medium-rare, 130° to 135°. Pull them off the grill.</li>
<li>Fish out the rosemary sprig from the sauce, and stir in the scallions. Pour it over the chops and enjoy.</li>
</ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>This quick grill dish makes it easy to come home after work and eat well. The secret is in the simple sauce all seasoned up with the classic flavor partners that lamb loves the most—rosemary and Dijon mustard.</li>
<li>Note: It’s not unusual for the fat cooking off the edges of lamb chops to make the grill flare up. If this happens, cover the grill to choke off all the air. In a few seconds the flames will die down and you can uncover the grill again.</li>
