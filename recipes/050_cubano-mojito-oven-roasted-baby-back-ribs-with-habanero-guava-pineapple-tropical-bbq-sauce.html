  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Ribs</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 racks pork baby back ribs (2 ½ to 3 pounds)</li>
<li>1 cup</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mojito Marinade</h3>
<ul>
<li>plus more to use as a mop sauce</li>
<li>Black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
<li>1 teaspoon minced habanero pepper</li>
<li>2 cups diced fresh pineapple</li>
<li>6 tablespoons guava paste ( (see note)</li>
<li>¼ cup lime juice</li>
<li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
<li>1 cup</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mutha Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 heaping tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Set the ribs in a shallow roasting pan, and pour the Mojito Marinade over them. Flip the ribs around in it to make sure they’re coated all over; then grind on lots of black pepper. Cover and marinate for 4 hours or overnight.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 250°. Put a wire rack over a jelly roll pan and pour 1 cup of water into the pan. Pull the ribs out of the marinade, scraping off any extra. Set the ribs on the rack, meaty side up. Slide them into the oven and roast slowly. Check every hour or so. If the meat looks dry, mop it lightly with some of the Mojito Marinade.</li>
<li>Cook up a batch of sauce while the ribs are roasting. Set a saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in the oil, and once it gets hot, add the ginger and habanero peppers. Cook for 1 minute. Dump in the pineapple and the guava paste, stirring til the guava paste dissolves. Add the lime and lemon juices and the Mutha Sauce. Simmer for a couple of minutes to blend the flavors. Stir in the cilantro. Set aside and heat up before serving.</li>
<li>Check the ribs for doneness after 2 ½ to 3 hours. They will be done if you can gently tear the meat between the bones or poke your finger through the meat, or if they’ve reached an internal temperature of at least 180°, or if they bend nicely when you grab them in the middle with a pair of tongs. Once they’re tender, glaze the ribs with some of the sauce and keep cooking for 15 to 20 minutes. Or for a caramelized finish, turn on the broiler and get the surface of the ribs sizzling. When they’re nicely bronzed, brush with the sauce.</li>
<li>Pull the ribs out and let them set for 5 to 10 minutes, then serve with the remaining sauce.</li>
<li>Apple-Brined Double Cut Pork Chops with Sausage &amp; Corn Bread Stuffing</li>
<li>FEEDS 4</li>
<li>Brine chops 8 to 24 hours before cooking using the Apple-Brine recipe and instructions.</li>
<li>Fire up the grill and then make the stuffing. Dump the crumbled corn bread into a bowl and set aside. Grab a skillet and melt the butter in it over medium-high heat. Toss in the onions and peppers and season with salt and pepper. Cook til soft, then toss in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Strip the casing off the sausage and crumble it into the skillet. Cook til it loses its pink color, chopping and stirring constantly to break up the pieces. Scrape it all into the corn bread. Mix in the parsley, Pecorino Romano, and eggs and season it all with thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper.</li>
<li>Take the chops out of the brine and dry them off. Push 3 large pinches of stuffing into the pocket of each chop. Really stuff it in there tightly, filling it nice and full. Brush the chops with olive oil and season both sides with pepper.</li>
<li>See how the grill’s doing. Pile the coals to one side. Sear the chops directly over the coals, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Be careful not to overcook them at this point, because it will make them curl up.</li>
<li>Slide the chops to the other side of the grill, away from the coals. Cover the grill and adjust the heat so that it’s about 350° inside. Cook the chops for 45 to 50 minutes. Take their temperature by inserting an instant-read thermometer horizontally into the meat, parallel to and close to the bone without touching it. When it reads 145°, baste the chops with the Mutha Sauce. Cover the grill again and continue cooking for another 10 minutes, or til the internal meat temperature reaches 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ).</li>
<li>Pull those plump babies off the grill and eat ’em up without delay.</li>
<li>FEEDS 6 TO 8</li>
<li>Throw all the jerk paste ingredients into a food processor. Start by processing with on/off pulses, scraping the workbowl down several times. Then continue processing to a paste. Set aside.</li>
<li>Slice each tenderloin lengthwise along the grain into 3 even slices. Pound each slice lightly with the edge of a mallet to make indentations on both sides without opening holes in the meat.</li>
<li>Save ½ cup of jerk paste for the sauce. Place the tenderloins in a nonreactive pan and rub the remaining jerk paste into all sides. Cover and marinate in the fridge for at least 4 hours or all day, if possible.</li>
<li>Fire up the grill good and hot. Throw all the ingredients for the sauce into a small saucepan and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Let it bubble for 15 minutes. Keep warm.</li>
<li>Scrape off most of the jerk paste from the meat so it doesn’t stew on the grill. Place the tenderloin slices directly over the coals and grill til the meat reaches an internal temperature of 145° to 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ), 4 to 5 minutes on each side.</li>
<li>Take the tenderloins off the grill, cut them into serving-size pieces, and pass them around with lots of sauce.</li>
<li>Pan-Fried Pork Medallions with Creole Honey-Mustard Sauce</li>
<li>It doesn’t get much easier than this—or tastier. That wonderful Zatarain’s Creole Mustard (see Resources ) is hard at work for you, makin’ an easy sweet and savory sauce that brings out the best in pork.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4 TO 5</li>
<li>Start with the sauce. Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Toss in the garlic with a pinch of salt. Cook for 1 minute, just to soften it a bit. Add the mustard, wine, Mutha Sauce, honey, and Creole Seasoning. Turn the heat down to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Keep warm on a back burner.</li>
<li>Sharpen your knife and slice the pork loin into ¾-inch medallions. You should get about 10. Season liberally on both sides with Creole Seasoning.</li>
<li>Drag a large cast-iron skillet over to the stove and turn the heat up to high. Heat the pan til smoking hot, about 10 minutes. Pour in the oil and heat for about 30 seconds. Add a few medallions—don’t crowd the pan—and cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Take them out and put them on a platter. Keep warm while you cook the rest of the medallions.</li>
<li>Swirl the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter into the warm sauce. Serve these tasty medallions with some of the sauce spooned over each one. Any sauce that’s left can be passed for ladling at the table.</li>
<li>FEEDS 6</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 500°. Get the butcher to cut the chine bone from the roast for easy carving later. Mix up all the ingredients for the rub, and massage it all over the roast. Place the roast, rib side down, in a roasting pan and pop it in the oven. Cook for 30 to 40 minutes to caramelize the outside, then lower the heat to 350° and continue roasting slowly for another 25 to 30 minutes, til the internal temperature registers 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ).</li>
<li>Throw together the sauce while the pork is roasting. Melt the butter in a saucepan. Toss in the garlic and jalapeños with a pinch of salt and pepper, cooking til soft. Dump in the apples and give them a stir. Cook til soft but not mushy, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the maple syrup, cinnamon, allspice, Mutha Sauce, and water, and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Keep warm.</li>
<li>Take the roast out of the oven and let it rest for 15 minutes. Slice the meat between the ribs into chops. Pour any meat juices that ooze out while carving into the sauce and stir it up a bit. Ladle some sauce onto each chop and sprinkle with scallions. Serve ’em up and pass the remaining sauce at the table.</li>
<li>Squeeze the roasted garlic pulp from each clove into a bowl. Add the salt, ground and flaked chiles, cumin, brown sugar, and olive oil and make a wet rub.</li>
<li>Stab holes into the pork loin and insert a quarter of a garlic clove into each. Massage the wet rub all over the meat, pushing some of it in between the two loins. Do this ahead, cover, and refrigerate overnight for maximum flavor penetration.</li>
<li>Fire up the grill, mounding a hot coal bed on one side. Just before grilling, season the meat all over with salt and a grinding of black pepper.</li>
<li>Set the meat directly over the coals to sear for 2 minutes, making sure to scrape onto the roast any of the coating rub stuck to the plate it was setting on. Sear the remaining 3 sides for 2 minutes each. Push the meat to the other side of the grill, away from the coals. Cover the grill and adjust the heat so that it’s from 325° to 350° inside. Roast for about 1 hour, til the meat reaches an internal temperature of 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ). Pull the roast off the grill and let it rest for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Carve and serve immediately, or let it cool completely and then slice for sandwiches.</li>
<li>Home-Style Pulled Bar-B-Que Pork</li>
<li>FEEDS 8</li>
<li>Check out the instructions in The Techniques of Outdoor Cookin’ .</li>
<li>Dump 9 cups of hickory wood chips in a bowl, cover with water, and let them soak for half an hour or so. Drain and divide them between 6 squares of aluminum foil. Wrap up into individual packets, poking holes in the top. Set aside.</li>
<li>Pull off the grill rack and fire up the grill. While that’s going on, mix together the oil and the rub. Rub this all over the pork butt. Once the coals are good and hot, pile them up on one side of the bottom of the grill and set 2 of the wood chip packets right on the coals. Position a drip pan filled with ½ inch of water on the side opposite the coals. Put the grill rack back in place. Set the pork butt, fat side up, over the drip pan, and close the lid. After about half an hour, check the grill temperature. It should settle down to 225° to 250°. If it’s hotter, close down the vent holes. If it’s cooler, open them up a bit.</li>
<li>Check the temperature of the grill every hour for the next 7 to 8 hours and make adjustments. If the temperature dips down to 200° or less, add a couple of hot new briquettes to the pile of gray coals, close the lid, and open the vent holes a bit.</li>
<li>Reach into the grill with some tongs after the pork butt’s been smoking for 1 ½ hours, and remove the old packets of wood chips. Toss two new packets of foil-wrapped chips onto the coals. Repeat after another 1 ½ hours.</li>
<li>After the pork butt’s been on the grill for 4 to 5 hours, you have achieved the necessary smoke penetration. It should be a rich mahogany brown, and the internal temperature should be about 155°. Grab the meat with tongs, remove it from the grill, and wrap it tightly in foil. Put the foil-wrapped pork butt back over the drip pan and cover the grill. Now you’re sealing in the succulence of the meat as you continue to cook. This will take another 3 to 3 ½ hours. So keep working to maintain an even temperature of 225° to 250°. The pork is done when you can push down on the foil and it doesn’t spring back or when you can pull out the shoulder blade bone easily without very much resistance.</li>
<li>Lift the foil-wrapped pork butt off the grill and let it rest (still covered in foil) for 10 to 15 minutes. Open the foil and strip off the fat cap on top of the meat, and then pull out the shoulder blade (if you haven’t already). Carefully pull the meat apart, removing any visible fat and connective tissue. Shred the meat by squishing it between your fingers—the dark meat will shred easily, but you might have to pull apart the whiter meat into strings.</li>
<li>Put the pulled pork into a baking pan and pour the Mutha Sauce over it. Use it right away, or cover it with foil and rewarm in a 200° oven. Now it’s ready to pack into rolls for sandwiches. Be sure to serve some more Mutha Sauce at the table.</li>
<li>State Fair Sausage &amp; Pepper Sandwich</li>
<li>“How ’bout a nice sausage sandwich?” From 1983 to 1988 my partner, Mike, and I belted that line out thousands of times at fairs and festivals up and down the East Coast. Those were the days of Dinosaur Concessions, when we made our living slingin’ sausage and charbroilin’ steak for sandwiches. We pretty much retired from the fair business in 1988 when we opened the Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. But ten years later we were back at it again. In 1998 we joined forces with Steve Davis from Gianelli Sausage, whose family stand has been a mainstay at the New York State Fair for as long as I can remember. Gianelli (see Resources ) makes a great sausage—lean, yet packed with flavor—just great for our State Fair Sausage &amp; Pepper Sandwich and all our other sausage specialties.</li>
<li>Slap 2 skillets on the stove. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in one and ¼ cup olive oil in the other. Dump the onions and peppers into the one with less oil and cook over medium-high heat, seasoning with salt and pepper. Heat the skillet with the larger amount of oil over medium heat for several minutes. Slide the sausages into the pan.</li>
<li>Cook for 15 minutes, or til they just lose their pinkness inside. Pull the sausages out of the pan and nestle them into the peppers and onions.</li>
<li>Slice up the rolls and stuff them full with sausages and peppers. Serve ’em up nice and hot with lots of napkins.</li>
<li>Fire up the grill and get it nice and hot while you do some cooking inside.</li>
<li>Slit the bootstrap tendon on the side of each chop (if there is one) in one place so the chops won’t curl on the grill. Mix up a paste of the Creole Seasoning and oil. Rub this generously into the chops. Set aside.</li>
<li>Get busy with the sauce. Slit the skin of the peaches on the bottom with an X, then plunge them into boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove, peel, and cut in half. Pluck out the pits, and slice the peaches up lengthwise.</li>
<li>Drop the butter into a saucepan set over medium heat. Once it melts, add the ginger and cook til soft. Slide in the peach slices and brown sugar and give it all a gentle stir. Pour in the brandy and ignite with a match. Once the flame dies down, add the Mutha Sauce and cinnamon and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Get out and check your grill. If you’re using charcoal, spread a nice even coal bed and set the chops directly over the coals. When the juices rise up to the surface near the bone, give the chops a flip. Continue cooking til the meat reaches an internal temperature of 145° to 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ). All in all, the chops should be done in 8 to 10 minutes. Don’t overcook them.</li>
<li>Serve ’em up on a platter with the sauce spooned all over.</li>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Note: Guava paste is found in the Hispanic foods section of your supermarket or in specialty stores carrying Hispanic foods.</li>
<li>This is one of the best ways we know to use up day-old corn bread. We mix it with spicy Italian sausage and stuff it into some bodacious pork chops to turn out one good-lookin’ dish for our Custom-Que menu.</li>
<li>Here’s an interesting technique. We cut (counter to logic) the pork tenderloins into long steaks along the grain of the meat, forming steaks approximately 10 inches long by 2 inches wide. Whip up the jerk paste the night before or that morning, and get the tenderloins marinating early. That way you can grill and eat in minutes after getting jerked around at work all day.</li>
<li>Come fall in Central New York, there’s nothing that clears your head better than a motorcycle ride through the countryside bustin’ with apple orchards and flamin’ with red sugar-maple trees. So it just comes naturally for us to combine apples, maple syrup, and barbecue.</li>
<li>This dish has some serious garlic happenin’. We developed it as one of a whole bunch of recipes for a Dinosaur garlic festival. It marked the birth of the Custom-Que at the restaurant, a special menu that’s broadened our repertoire and given our customers a taste of some unique dishes influenced by the world of wood-fired cookin’.</li>
<li>Pulled pork is one of the wonders of true blue barbecue. It starts with a pork butt, also called a Boston butt, which is the meat surrounding the shoulder blade of the pig. This is a tough, fatty piece that’s magically transformed with spices, smoke, and slow cookin’ into something lean and melt-in-your-mouth tender.</li>
<li>When the peaches are perfect, ripe and succulent, make this dish. The real fun comes when you set the sauce ablaze. Just watch your eyebrows!</li>
