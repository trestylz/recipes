    "2 racks pork baby back ribs (2 ½ to 3 pounds)",
    "1 cup Mojito Marinade plus more to use as a mop sauce",
    "Black pepper",
    "1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
    "1 tablespoon minced ginger",

    "Preheat the oven to 250°. Put a wire rack over a jelly roll pan and pour 1 cup of water into the pan. Pull the ribs out of the marinade, scraping off any extra. Set the ribs on the rack, meaty side up. Slide them into the oven and roast slowly. Check every hour or so. If the meat looks dry, mop it lightly with some of the Mojito Marinade.",
    "Cook up a batch of sauce while the ribs are roasting. Set a saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour in the oil, and once it gets hot, add the ginger and habanero peppers. Cook for 1 minute. Dump in the pineapple and the guava paste, stirring til the guava paste dissolves. Add the lime and lemon juices and the Mutha Sauce. Simmer for a couple of minutes to blend the flavors. Stir in the cilantro. Set aside and heat up before serving.",
    "Check the ribs for doneness after 2 ½ to 3 hours. They will be done if you can gently tear the meat between the bones or poke your finger through the meat, or if they’ve reached an internal temperature of at least 180°, or if they bend nicely when you grab them in the middle with a pair of tongs. Once they’re tender, glaze the ribs with some of the sauce and keep cooking for 15 to 20 minutes. Or for a caramelized finish, turn on the broiler and get the surface of the ribs sizzling. When they’re nicely bronzed, brush with the sauce.",
    "Pull the ribs out and let them set for 5 to 10 minutes, then serve with the remaining sauce.",
    "There was a time when folks cooked pork to death, bringing the internal temperature up as high as 185°. To a certain extent, you could get away with this 25 to 30 years ago because pork was a fattier meat back then and retained some natural succulence even when overcooked.",
    "Today everything’s changed about pork. It’s safe, it’s lean, it’s even considered the “Other White Meat.” The National Pork Producers Council recommends against overcooking pork. They have established 155° as their ideal internal temperature, which is right in the medium-well-done temperature range.",
    "When I’m not slow cooking pork I still crave succulence, and so I prefer to cook pork just a bit less—to 145° or 150°, which is perfectly medium. The internal temperature of roasts and thick cuts will naturally rise by 5 to 10 degrees during the required resting time after you pull ’em from the oven or off the grill.",
    "You should decide how you like your pork and cook it that way, now that you’ve got some opinions to consider."
