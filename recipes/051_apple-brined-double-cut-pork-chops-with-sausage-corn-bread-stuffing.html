    "Mutha Sauce for basting",

    "Fire up the grill and then make the stuffing. Dump the crumbled corn bread into a bowl and set aside. Grab a skillet and melt the butter in it over medium-high heat. Toss in the onions and peppers and season with salt and pepper. Cook til soft, then toss in the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Strip the casing off the sausage and crumble it into the skillet. Cook til it loses its pink color, chopping and stirring constantly to break up the pieces. Scrape it all into the corn bread. Mix in the parsley, Pecorino Romano, and eggs and season it all with thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper.",

    "See how the grill’s doing. Pile the coals to one side. Sear the chops directly over the coals, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Be careful not to overcook them at this point, because it will make them curl up.",
    "Slide the chops to the other side of the grill, away from the coals. Cover the grill and adjust the heat so that it’s about 350° inside. Cook the chops for 45 to 50 minutes. Take their temperature by inserting an instant-read thermometer horizontally into the meat, parallel to and close to the bone without touching it. When it reads 145°, baste the chops with the Mutha Sauce. Cover the grill again and continue cooking for another 10 minutes, or til the internal meat temperature reaches 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ).",
    "Pull those plump babies off the grill and eat ’em up without delay.",
    "The new leaner style pork is missing something—fat. That great old conveyor of flavor and succulence has been bred right out of the loin meat of my favorite critter. Lean meat may be healthier, but I found that eating a pork chop was just not worth tiring my jaws out. That changed when I got turned on to brining. During the process the protein strands in the meat unwind and then get tangled up with other unwound strands, allowing them to trap moisture inside these new little webs. This results in juicier meat with better texture after cooking. Things get even better if you add some sugar to the brine, which boosts the caramelized flavor of the grilled surface of the meat. Give it a try and see for yourself how adding a brining step to your pork prep will have you lickin’ your chops again.",
    "Add chops to the brine and let them marinate in the refrigerator for 8 to 12 hours. Pull them out and dry them off before using in a recipe."
