Sear the remaining 3 sides for 2 minutes each. Push the meat to the other side of the grill, away from the coals. Cover the grill and adjust the heat so that it’s from 325° to 350° inside. Roast for about 1 hour, til the meat reaches an internal temperature of 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ). Pull the roast off the grill and let it rest for 15 minutes.",
    "Carve and serve immediately, or let it cool completely and then slice for sandwiches."
