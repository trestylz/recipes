  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Rub</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 bulbs</li>
</ul>
<h3>Roasted Garlic</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
<li>2 teaspoons ground ancho chile</li>
<li>2 teaspoons dried flaked chipotle chile</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>2 teaspoons brown sugar</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Roast</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 boneless double pork loin roast (about 3 pounds)</li>
<li>4 large cloves garlic, quartered</li>
<li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Squeeze the roasted garlic pulp from each clove into a bowl. Add the salt, ground and flaked chiles, cumin, brown sugar, and olive oil and make a wet rub.</li>
<li>Stab holes into the pork loin and insert a quarter of a garlic clove into each. Massage the wet rub all over the meat, pushing some of it in between the two loins. Do this ahead, cover, and refrigerate overnight for maximum flavor penetration.</li>
<li>Fire up the grill, mounding a hot coal bed on one side. Just before grilling, season the meat all over with salt and a grinding of black pepper.</li>
<li>Set the meat directly over the coals to sear for 2 minutes, making sure to scrape onto the roast any of the coating rub stuck to the plate it was setting on. Sear the remaining 3 sides for 2 minutes each. Push the meat to the other side of the grill, away from the coals. Cover the grill and adjust the heat so that it’s from 325° to 350° inside. Roast for about 1 hour, til the meat reaches an internal temperature of 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ). Pull the roast off the grill and let it rest for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Carve and serve immediately, or let it cool completely and then slice for sandwiches.</li>
<li>Home-Style Pulled Bar-B-Que Pork</li>
<li>FEEDS 8</li>
<li>Check out the instructions in The Techniques of Outdoor Cookin’ .</li>
<li>Dump 9 cups of hickory wood chips in a bowl, cover with water, and let them soak for half an hour or so. Drain and divide them between 6 squares of aluminum foil. Wrap up into individual packets, poking holes in the top. Set aside.</li>
<li>Pull off the grill rack and fire up the grill. While that’s going on, mix together the oil and the rub. Rub this all over the pork butt. Once the coals are good and hot, pile them up on one side of the bottom of the grill and set 2 of the wood chip packets right on the coals. Position a drip pan filled with ½ inch of water on the side opposite the coals. Put the grill rack back in place. Set the pork butt, fat side up, over the drip pan, and close the lid. After about half an hour, check the grill temperature. It should settle down to 225° to 250°. If it’s hotter, close down the vent holes. If it’s cooler, open them up a bit.</li>
<li>Check the temperature of the grill every hour for the next 7 to 8 hours and make adjustments. If the temperature dips down to 200° or less, add a couple of hot new briquettes to the pile of gray coals, close the lid, and open the vent holes a bit.</li>
<li>Reach into the grill with some tongs after the pork butt’s been smoking for 1 ½ hours, and remove the old packets of wood chips. Toss two new packets of foil-wrapped chips onto the coals. Repeat after another 1 ½ hours.</li>
<li>After the pork butt’s been on the grill for 4 to 5 hours, you have achieved the necessary smoke penetration. It should be a rich mahogany brown, and the internal temperature should be about 155°. Grab the meat with tongs, remove it from the grill, and wrap it tightly in foil. Put the foil-wrapped pork butt back over the drip pan and cover the grill. Now you’re sealing in the succulence of the meat as you continue to cook. This will take another 3 to 3 ½ hours. So keep working to maintain an even temperature of 225° to 250°. The pork is done when you can push down on the foil and it doesn’t spring back or when you can pull out the shoulder blade bone easily without very much resistance.</li>
<li>Lift the foil-wrapped pork butt off the grill and let it rest (still covered in foil) for 10 to 15 minutes. Open the foil and strip off the fat cap on top of the meat, and then pull out the shoulder blade (if you haven’t already). Carefully pull the meat apart, removing any visible fat and connective tissue. Shred the meat by squishing it between your fingers—the dark meat will shred easily, but you might have to pull apart the whiter meat into strings.</li>
<li>Put the pulled pork into a baking pan and pour the Mutha Sauce over it. Use it right away, or cover it with foil and rewarm in a 200° oven. Now it’s ready to pack into rolls for sandwiches. Be sure to serve some more Mutha Sauce at the table.</li>
<li>State Fair Sausage &amp; Pepper Sandwich</li>
<li>“How ’bout a nice sausage sandwich?” From 1983 to 1988 my partner, Mike, and I belted that line out thousands of times at fairs and festivals up and down the East Coast. Those were the days of Dinosaur Concessions, when we made our living slingin’ sausage and charbroilin’ steak for sandwiches. We pretty much retired from the fair business in 1988 when we opened the Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. But ten years later we were back at it again. In 1998 we joined forces with Steve Davis from Gianelli Sausage, whose family stand has been a mainstay at the New York State Fair for as long as I can remember. Gianelli (see Resources ) makes a great sausage—lean, yet packed with flavor—just great for our State Fair Sausage &amp; Pepper Sandwich and all our other sausage specialties.</li>

<li>Slap 2 skillets on the stove. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in one and ¼ cup olive oil in the other. Dump the onions and peppers into the one with less oil and cook over medium-high heat, seasoning with salt and pepper. Heat the skillet with the larger amount of oil over medium heat for several minutes. Slide the sausages into the pan.</li>
<li>Cook for 15 minutes, or til they just lose their pinkness inside. Pull the sausages out of the pan and nestle them into the peppers and onions.</li>
<li>Slice up the rolls and stuff them full with sausages and peppers. Serve ’em up nice and hot with lots of napkins.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4</li>
<li>Fire up the grill and get it nice and hot while you do some cooking inside.</li>
<li>Slit the bootstrap tendon on the side of each chop (if there is one) in one place so the chops won’t curl on the grill. Mix up a paste of the Creole Seasoning and oil. Rub this generously into the chops. Set aside.</li>
<li>Get busy with the sauce. Slit the skin of the peaches on the bottom with an X, then plunge them into boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove, peel, and cut in half. Pluck out the pits, and slice the peaches up lengthwise.</li>
<li>Drop the butter into a saucepan set over medium heat. Once it melts, add the ginger and cook til soft. Slide in the peach slices and brown sugar and give it all a gentle stir. Pour in the brandy and ignite with a match. Once the flame dies down, add the Mutha Sauce and cinnamon and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Get out and check your grill. If you’re using charcoal, spread a nice even coal bed and set the chops directly over the coals. When the juices rise up to the surface near the bone, give the chops a flip. Continue cooking til the meat reaches an internal temperature of 145° to 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ). All in all, the chops should be done in 8 to 10 minutes. Don’t overcook them.</li>
<li>Serve ’em up on a platter with the sauce spooned all over.</li>
</ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pulled pork is one of the wonders of true blue barbecue. It starts with a pork butt, also called a Boston butt, which is the meat surrounding the shoulder blade of the pig. This is a tough, fatty piece that’s magically transformed with spices, smoke, and slow cookin’ into something lean and melt-in-your-mouth tender.</li>
<li>When the peaches are perfect, ripe and succulent, make this dish. The real fun comes when you set the sauce ablaze. Just watch your eyebrows!</li>
