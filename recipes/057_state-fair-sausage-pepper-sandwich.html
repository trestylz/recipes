  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 tablespoons plus ¼ cup olive oil</li>
<li>1 ½ large onions, sliced into thick strips</li>
<li>1 large red bell pepper, sliced into thick strips</li>
<li>1 large green pepper, sliced into thick strips</li>
<li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
<li>2 pounds Italian sausage, hot or sweet</li>
<li>6 crusty submarine rolls</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Slap 2 skillets on the stove. Put 2 tablespoons of olive oil in one and ¼ cup olive oil in the other. Dump the onions and peppers into the one with less oil and cook over medium-high heat, seasoning with salt and pepper. Heat the skillet with the larger amount of oil over medium heat for several minutes. Slide the sausages into the pan.</li>
<li>Cook for 15 minutes, or til they just lose their pinkness inside. Pull the sausages out of the pan and nestle them into the peppers and onions.</li>
<li>Slice up the rolls and stuff them full with sausages and peppers. Serve ’em up nice and hot with lots of napkins.</li>
<li>FEEDS 4</li>
<li>Fire up the grill and get it nice and hot while you do some cooking inside.</li>
<li>Slit the bootstrap tendon on the side of each chop (if there is one) in one place so the chops won’t curl on the grill. Mix up a paste of the Creole Seasoning and oil. Rub this generously into the chops. Set aside.</li>
<li>Get busy with the sauce. Slit the skin of the peaches on the bottom with an X, then plunge them into boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove, peel, and cut in half. Pluck out the pits, and slice the peaches up lengthwise.</li>
<li>Drop the butter into a saucepan set over medium heat. Once it melts, add the ginger and cook til soft. Slide in the peach slices and brown sugar and give it all a gentle stir. Pour in the brandy and ignite with a match. Once the flame dies down, add the Mutha Sauce and cinnamon and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Get out and check your grill. If you’re using charcoal, spread a nice even coal bed and set the chops directly over the coals. When the juices rise up to the surface near the bone, give the chops a flip. Continue cooking til the meat reaches an internal temperature of 145° to 150° (see Cookin’ Perfect Pork ). All in all, the chops should be done in 8 to 10 minutes. Don’t overcook them.</li>
<li>Serve ’em up on a platter with the sauce spooned all over.</li>
</ol>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>When the peaches are perfect, ripe and succulent, make this dish. The real fun comes when you set the sauce ablaze. Just watch your eyebrows!</li>
