  <h1>Fresh-Cut Fries</h1>
  <p><strong>Category:</strong> Sides</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>Peanut oil to fill your deep-fryer (about 1 gallon for a home fryer)</li>
<li>1 ½ large russet or all-purpose potatoes per person</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Fill a deep-fryer or a deep pan with oil. Heat to 325°. Wash and dry each potato well. Don’t peel them. Cut the potatoes in half lengthwise and then into ½-inch fingers. Try to cut even pieces so you won’t have any cooking issues later.</li>
<li>Blanch the fries in batches in hot oil. Don’t crowd—a gallon fryer will hold 2 to 3 potatoes’ worth of fries at a time. Cook for 7 to 8 minutes, til they give when you pinch them softly. Drain in a single layer on paper towels or brown paper bags, and let them cool down to room temperature.</li>
<li>Raise the temperature of the oil to 375°. Add the fries in batches (don’t crowd them this time either) and fry again til golden and erect, another 7 to 8 minutes. Drain on paper towels or brown paper bags and season right away with salt. Serve as fast as you can—freshly cooked, hot, and crispy.</li>
</ol>
