  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>¼ cup butter</li>
<li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
<li>¾ cup chopped green pepper</li>
<li>1 medium jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced</li>
<li>Sprinkling plus 2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>Sprinkling plus 1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
<li>4 large cloves garlic, minced</li>
<li>4 cups whole milk</li>
<li>1 cup quick grits</li>
<li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
<li>¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese Tabasco sauce</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Sling half of the butter into a saucepan and melt it over medium-high heat. Dump in the onions, peppers, and jalapeños. Season with a sprinkling of salt and pepper and cook til soft. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more.</li>
<li>Pour in the milk, cover, and bring to a boil. (Watch it so it doesn’t boil over.) Turn the heat down to medium-low and slowly stir in the grits. Cook, covered, for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
<li>Pull the pan off the heat and hurl in the cheeses, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Stir it around til the cheeses are melted and incorporated into the grits; then spice it all up with some Tabasco and fold in the remaining butter.</li>
<li>Spoon the grits up and serve pronto. Or, if serving later, butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan and preheat the oven to 350°. Spoon in the grits and level with a spatula. Throw them into the oven and bake for 45 minutes. Cool and cut into geometric shapes for frying or grilling later.</li>
