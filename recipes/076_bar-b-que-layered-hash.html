    "2 pounds all-purpose potatoes",
    "⅓ plus ¼ cup vegetable oil",
    "Kosher salt and black pepper",
    "2 cups chopped onion",
    "1 medium jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced",

    "Preheat the oven to 425°. Set a kettle on the stove, fill it with salted water, and plop in the potatoes with their skins on. Get the pot boiling and cook the potatoes til very tender. Pull them out and peel them, then dice into ½-inch cubes and set aside.",
    "Pour ⅓ cup oil into a heavy cast-iron skillet set over medium-high heat. Dump in the potatoes and spread them in an even layer covering the bottom of the pan. Season those spuds real well with salt and pepper. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, til light golden brown. Peek under one section to check the browning before giving the whole thing a flip by putting a plate over the pan and flipping the potatoes onto the plate. Do this carefully, protecting your hands with potholder mitts. Scrape out any potatoes stuck to the pan. Then, if the pan looks dry, add a bit more oil and slide the potatoes back in, cooked side up. Cook for another 8 to 10 minutes, til golden and crispy. Move the pan off the heat if you’re not ready with the next layers.",
    "Sling another pan onto the stove and turn the heat up to medium-high. Pour in ¼ cup oil and add the onions and jalapeños, seasoning them with salt and pepper. Once they’re soft, add the leftover meat and Mutha Sauce and stir it all up.",
    "Spread the meat mixture over the potatoes in an even layer, pressing it down with the back of a spatula. Throw on a layer of shredded cheese, and pop the pan into the hot oven for 15 minutes. Once the cheese is melted, pull the hash out and let it rest for 10 minutes to make for easier cutting. Sprinkle the top with Creole Seasoning and scallions. Cut into wedges and serve right from the pan."
