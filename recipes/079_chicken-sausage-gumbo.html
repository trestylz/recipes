  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Heat up the oil in a heavy-bottomed soup kettle over medium-high heat til hot but not smoking. Add the chicken in batches so you’re not crowding the pieces. Cook, turning pieces often, til they’re lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. As the pieces get done, toss them into a bowl. Add the sausage slices to the same pot and cook long enough to render out the fat. Pluck the sausage out of the pot and drain on paper towels.</li>
<li>Pour off all but ¼ cup of fat from the pot. Swish the pot with ¼ cup of the broth, scraping in all the tasty bits. Put the pot back on the stove and throw in the onions, celery, green peppers, and jalapeños, seasoning them with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook til soft over medium-high and then add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the Brown Roux and give everything a good stir. Whisk in the remaining 5 cups of broth. Dump in the chicken along with any accumulated juices (no sausage yet), and throw in the bay leaves.</li>
<li>Cover the pan and bring the contents to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for about 1 hour. Every now and then, skim the oil that comes to the surface and give the gumbo a stir. Once the gumbo gets a nice velvety look, toss the sausage back in and season with thyme and a generous amount of Tabasco. Pull out the bay leaves, check the seasonings, and sprinkle with parsley.</li>
<li>Spoon some Perfect Rice into a bunch of bowls. Ladle the gumbo over it and bring it to the table.</li>
