Put the pot back on the stove and throw in the onions, celery, green peppers, and jalapeños, seasoning them with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook til soft over medium-high and then add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the Brown Roux and give everything a good stir. Whisk in the remaining 5 cups of broth. Dump in the chicken along with any accumulated juices (no sausage yet), and throw in the bay leaves.",
    "Cover the pan and bring the contents to a boil. Turn down the heat to a simmer and cook for about 1 hour. Every now and then, skim the oil that comes to the surface and give the gumbo a stir. Once the gumbo gets a nice velvety look, toss the sausage back in and season with thyme and a generous amount of Tabasco. Pull out the bay leaves, check the seasonings, and sprinkle with parsley.",
    "Spoon some Perfect Rice into a bunch of bowls. Ladle the gumbo over it and bring it to the table."
