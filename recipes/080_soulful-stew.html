</ul>
<h3>Chicken Stock)</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 can (14 ½ ounces) diced tomatoes</li>
<li>1 cup</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mutha Sauce</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>2 cups sliced carrots</li>
<li>1 can (15 ounces) black-eyed peas, drained</li>
<li>1 can (15 ounces) corn kernels, drained</li>
<li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
<li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
<li>Tabasco sauce</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Strip any large, tough stems from the spinach and give it a good washing. Dry the leaves in a salad spinner or pat dry. Stack 10 leaves on top of one another and roll them up like a cigar. Slice into wide ribbons. Continue til all the leaves are sliced; set aside.</li>
<li>Cut the chicken into 1 by ¾-inch strips. Season the flour with salt and pepper, and toss the chicken in it. Set a large Dutch oven on the stove and heat 6 tablespoons of the olive oil over medium-high. Add the chicken in batches and brown lightly. As the chicken gets done, scoop it out of the pot into a bowl. Set aside.</li>
<li>Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the pot if it looks dry, and toss in the onions, green peppers, celery, and jalapeños, seasoning them with a pinch of salt and pepper. Stir in the ham and garlic and cook for 2 minutes more. Dump the chicken back in, along with its juices. Add the bay leaf, broth, tomatoes, Mutha Sauce, Worcestershire, and carrots. Cover the pot and bring everything to a boil; then crack the lid, turn down the heat to low, and simmer til the carrots are soft, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
<li>Uncover the pot and throw in the black-eyed peas, corn, and spinach. Season the stew with the cumin, thyme, and oregano, and let everything simmer for another 15 minutes to blend the flavors. Take out the bay leaf and taste the stew to see if it needs some salt and pepper; then spice everything up with Tabasco.</li>
<li>Serve the stew steamin’ hot in great big soup bowls.</li>
