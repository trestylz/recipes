  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Crust</h3>
<ul>
<li>20 Oreo sandwich cookies</li>
<li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Filling</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
<li>⅓ cup flour</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
<li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>1 cup chocolate chips</li>
<li>3 cups milk</li>
<li>3 large egg yolks</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vanilla</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Garnish</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sweetened whipped cream</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Start with the crust. Crumble the cookies into the workbowl of a food processor and process to crumbs. This will give you about 2 cups. Put them in a bowl and mix in the melted butter. Press the crumbs evenly over the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Chill.</li>
<li>Get busy making the filling. Sift the sugar, cornstarch, flour, salt, and cinnamon together into a bowl and set aside.</li>
<li>Combine the chocolate chips and milk in a saucepan and set it over medium heat, stirring constantly. As soon as the chips are melted, pull the pan off the heat and pour half of the chocolate mixture into the dry ingredients. Mix well.</li>
<li>Whisk the yolks and vanilla together in a bowl and pour into the remaining chocolate in the saucepan. Stir it around and then add the chocolate and dry ingredient mixture. Set the saucepan back over medium heat and whisk like crazy. Once the mixture starts to thicken, keep whisking and cooking for 2 minutes. Pour the chocolate filling into a bowl to cool for 10 minutes; then dump it into the pie shell and level the top. Chill for several hours in the fridge. Cut into wedges and serve slathered with whipped cream.</li>
