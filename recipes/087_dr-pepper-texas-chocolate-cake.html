  <p><strong>Category:</strong> Desserts</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>The Cake</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 cups sifted flour</li>
<li>1 cup sugar</li>
<li>1 cup dark brown sugar</li>
<li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
<li>1 cup Dr Pepper</li>
<li>½ cup chocolate chips</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
<li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Frosting</h3>
<ul>
<li>¾ cup butter-flavored vegetable shortening</li>
<li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
<li>4 cups sifted confectioners’ sugar</li>
<li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
<li>¼ cup Dr Pepper</li>
<li>1 ½ teaspoons vanilla</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Get the oven heating to 350°. Grease and flour two 9-inch-round cake pans, tapping out any extra flour.</li>
<li>Sift together the flour, sugar, brown sugar, cocoa, and baking soda into a bowl and set aside. Pour the Dr Pepper into a saucepan and add the chocolate chips. Heat on low, stirring often, til the chips are just melted. Pull off the heat and set aside.</li>
<li>Combine the eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla in a mixer bowl and mix on medium speed til combined, about 2 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the Dr Pepper-chocolate mixture and continue beating til combined, about 1 minute.</li>
<li>Drop the mixer speed back to low and gradually add the dry ingredients. Pop the speed back up to medium and beat 2 minutes more. Divide the batter between the 2 pans.</li>
<li>Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or til a toothpick poked into the center comes out clean. Cool the layers in the pans for 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edges and flip the pans over onto a cooling rack. Gently lift off the pans and let the cake layers cool completely.</li>
<li>Whip up the frosting. First drop the shortening and butter into a mixer bowl and beat til soft and fluffy. Add the confectioners’ sugar and cocoa and continue mixing til combined. Stir together the Dr Pepper and vanilla and very slowly pour it into the frosting, beating with the mixer on high speed to thin it down a bit. Continue beating til light and fluffy, about 1 minute.</li>
<li>Set 1 layer, top down, on a good-looking plate. Smear on 1 cup of the frosting. Grab the other layer and slap it on top of the frosted one. Spread the rest of the frosting all over the top and sides of the cake, making attractive swirls. Serve, and accept the compliments.</li>
