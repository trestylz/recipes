  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 cup minced onion</li>
<li>½ cup minced green pepper</li>
<li>1 jalapeño pepper, seeded and minced</li>
<li>Pinch each of kosher salt and black pepper</li>
<li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
<li>1 can (28 ounces) tomato sauce</li>
<li>2 cups ketchup (preferably Heinz)</li>
<li>1 cup water</li>
<li>¾ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
<li>½ cup cider vinegar</li>
<li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
<li>¼ cup molasses</li>
<li>¼ cup cayenne pepper sauce</li>
<li>¼ cup spicy brown mustard</li>
<li>¾ cup dark brown sugar, packed</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
<li>2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
<li>1 tablespoon Liquid Smoke (optional)</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pour the oil into a large saucepan and set over medium-high heat. Toss in the onions, green peppers, and jalapeños and give them a stir. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper and cook til soft and golden. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Dump in everything else except the Liquid Smoke. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat so the sauce simmers. Simmer for 10 minutes. Swirl in the Liquid Smoke and let the sauce cool. Pour it into a container, cover, and store in the fridge til ready to use.</li>
<li>Variation: Hot BBQ Sauce</li>
<li>Add 2 or 3 seeded and minced habanero peppers (about 1 ½ teaspoons to 1 tablespoon) along with the onions, peppers, and jalapeños. Also add ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper along with the other ingredients for extra punch.</li>
<li>Danger!!! Working with habaneros can cause plenty of personal pain and suffering if you’re not careful. Never touch the cut flesh or seeds with your bare hands. While it won’t sting your hands (unless you’ve got a cut), the volatile oils from the peppers get into your pores and can be transferred to your eyes or other moist, sensitive areas on your body long after you’re done cookin’. Even washing your hands doesn’t help. So wear latex gloves while working with habaneros and be sure to protect your hands while cleaning up your cutting board and knife as well. Then toss out the gloves.</li>
