  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>2 large bulbs garlic</li>
<li>Olive oil</li>
<li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 375°. Cut the top off of each bulb, slicing into the points of the cloves. Place them cut side up on a piece of foil. Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Wrap the foil up around the bulbs and bake for 45 to 60 minutes, til they release their perfume. Open the foil and test for doneness. The cloves should squeeze softly when pinched. Bake a little longer if they seem to need it. Roasted garlic keeps for several days in the fridge.</li>
