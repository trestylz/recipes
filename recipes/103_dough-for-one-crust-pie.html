Flour the work surface and roll the dough out with a floured rolling pin into a circle 12 ½ inches in diameter. Fold the dough in half and put it into a 9-inch pie pan. Unfold it and press it into the pan, trimming the edges if you need to. Roll the edge under and shape a high fluted edge all around. Toss the finished pie shell into the freezer to chill while making the filling."
