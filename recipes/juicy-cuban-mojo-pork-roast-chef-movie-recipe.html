<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>1 Combine Marinade ingredients in a food processor and blend until the herbs and garlic are finely chopped. Alternatively, you can finely chop/mince the garlic and herbs then mix all ingredients in a bowl. 2 Place in a large ziplock bag with the pork. Place in the fridge overnight (in a bowl, just to be safe). 3 Remove the pork from the Marinade and leave on counter for 1 hour (bring to room temp). Reserve the Marinade. 4 Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan). 5 Roast, uncovered, for 30 minutes. Base with pan juices. 6 Reduce heat to 190°C/375°F (170°C). Roast for another 1 1/2 - 2 hours, basting every half hour, until the internal temperature reaches 70°/160°F. At this temperature, the pork is cooked, still juicy, and carvable, as it is intended to be (Note 1) 7 Fall-apart tender alternative (not slicable, meat falls apart): Roast at 160°C/320°F (all oven types) for 3 1/2 hours, or until the meat can be easily shredded using 2 forks (check on side). 8 Remove from the oven and place on a plate, loosely covered with foil. Rest for 20 minutes before serving with the Mojo Sauce on the side. I decorated mine with pan fried slices of oranges and extra cilantro/coriander leaves. 9 Mojo Sauce 10 Place the reserved Marinade, Mojo Sauce ingredients and 2 tbsp of the roasting pan drippings into a small saucepan. Bring to boil and add salt and pepper to taste. You might also want to add more lime juice or even a touch of sugar. Turn the heat down and simmer for 1 minute, then remove from the stove and set aside.</li>
