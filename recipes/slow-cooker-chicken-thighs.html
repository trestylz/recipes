  <li>1/2 tsp. Italian seasoning</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp. onion powder</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp. paprika</li>
  <li>3 tsp. kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 tsp. ground black pepper</li>
  <li>6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 pounds)</li>
  <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
  <li>1 lb. carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
  <li>1 lb. baby white potatoes, halved if large</li>
  <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
  <li>4 thyme sprigs</li>
  <li>2 shallots, sliced</li>
  <li>1/4 c. low-sodium chicken broth</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>1 In a small bowl, mix together the garlic powder, Italian seasoning, onion powder, paprika, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the pepper. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel, then season all sides with the spice mixture, rubbing it in to coat. 2 In a large cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook until golden brown, about 4 minutes. Remove to a plate. 3 Arrange the carrots and potatoes in a single layer in a 6-quart slow cooker. Scatter the garlic, thyme, and shallots over the top. Season with the remaining 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, then pour the chicken broth over everything. 4 Arrange the chicken, skin-side up, in a single layer on top of the vegetables in the slow cooker. Scatter the cubed butter over the top. Cover and cook on low heat for 4 to 6 hours, or on high heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, until the internal temperature of the chicken is 165°F and the potatoes and carrots are tender. If you would like a slightly thicker sauce, remove the chicken thighs to a plate. In a small bowl, whisk together the cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water. Add the cornstarch slurry to the slow cooker and stir until incorporated. Add the chicken back to the slow cooker, cover, and cook on high for 5 to 10 minutes, until the sauce is thickened. Serve the chicken on top of the vegetables. Spoon over some liquid from the slow cooker and sprinkle with parsley, if you like.</li>
